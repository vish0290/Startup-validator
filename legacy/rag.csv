I have an idea for a safety device that could benefit the company I currently work for. The idea has potential not just within the company but across the entire mining industry.

That pretty squarely falls under ""works for hire"", and whether or not your job description includes making an invention or a solution the problem, they paid you to work on their problems and they own your solutions.\n\nThat said, the way to sell this idea is to quit, and pursue the idea external to the your current employer.', 'No such thing.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37f9d,1ghx0de,Startup or biz unit in current company?,"Hi folks, looking some perspective here. I have been working on validating a problem for a while now and I am at the point where I want to seriously work on it.

My day job is running product at a fintech firm, and I am somewhat close to the Founder/CEO. So I approached him about the idea, somewhat naively hoping that I could fish out some pre-seed money. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything really, but figured no harm in asking.

Turns out the CEO is quite interested, but wants to develop it as a new business division. I suppose hindsight, this should have been an obvious potential outcomes.

What‚Äôs makes the proposal sensible is that my current firm operates in the same industry, practically serving the same clients albeit on different solutions. Working within the firm would give me access to resources - a technology team to build the product, sales people who are very well connected within the industry, and firm has big-name investors, which could open doors, especially valuable in my industry which is quite risk averse.

But, where there is trepidation: my firm is currently stretched across multiple products, and is still searching for product market fit. I‚Äôm afraid that by attaching my idea to a company that is already struggling at prioritizing and gaining traction, I will be spending my time fighting for resources internally rather than building the business.

I could strike out by myself and start a company... but it‚Äôll be the first time I‚Äôm doing this and I‚Äôll be starting from scratch. No money, no people, and while I understand the problem space and have some contacts, I‚Äôve never handled sales by myself, which will be crucial in getting this off the ground. A lot of this is well outside my comfort zone.

And yet, I guess I‚Äôm curious about doing a startup? I'm feeling stagnant in my current role and looking for a new challenge. I‚Äôm compensated well enough at the moment, but little growth is likely until/unless my firm finds product market fit. Level/title progression is also unlikely, given the size of the firm, and I don‚Äôt have any equity.

I think I‚Äôve found a real problem that I am equipped to address, and while there certainly will be risk, I don‚Äôt want the potential rewards diluted.

So with all of that, I‚Äôm turning to this subreddit for prerspective. What would you do in my shoes - start your own company or build a new business unit? Anyone here has done one or the other, and what was the result?

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c95,1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace ‚Äî Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don‚Äôt**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash‚Äôs founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub‚Äôs early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **‚ÄúAha‚Äù Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb‚Äôs Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace‚Äôs reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors‚Äô successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace‚Äôs liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37dc6,1gwu3ts,Idea Validation: AI-Powered Lyric Replacement Program,"I've been thinking about an idea and wanted to get some feedback on its feasibility and whether it might have any real business demand. The concept involves using AI to personalize songs by replacing part or all of the lyrics while preserving the original artist's unique vocal style.

The idea is to uses AI to change lyrics in a song while keeping the original artist's unique voice and style. For example, if there‚Äôs a song where the artist sings someone‚Äôs name, this system could swap that name out for a different one, and it‚Äôll still sound like the same artist singing it, with the same tone, style, and emotion. This could be used in music streaming platforms to create personalized song, or in apps like TikTok to generate custom audio tracks for user-generated content.

How It Works:
The AI is trained using recordings of the artist‚Äôs voice, along with the musical scores and lyrics (or phonemes). This helps the system learn how the artist sings‚Äîlike their tone, pitch, and timing.
When it‚Äôs time to make changes, the program takes the original song, separates the voice from the instruments, and identifies the part of the vocal line to change. Then, using the new lyrics and pitch details from the original song, it generates a new vocal segment that sounds just like the artist. This new piece is added back to the song, replacing the old section.

Example Use Case:
Imagine a song where the artist sings, ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Sarah.‚Äù With this system, you could change ""Sarah"" to another name, like ""David,"" and it would still sound like the same artist singing it. The rest of the song stays untouched‚Äîsame voice, same style, same everything‚Äîjust a new name in the lyrics.

It could also be used to:

Localize songs into different languages while keeping the artist's original singing style.

Create clean versions of songs by swapping out explicit lyrics.

This is an easy way to personalize or adapt music without needing the artist to re-record anything.

This process can currently be achieved through methods like recording a new version of the song with the desired lyrics and then use voice conversion, or through extensive audio editing and manual adjustments. However, my goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient approach that automates this process using AI, making it faster and more accessible while maintaining the quality and authenticity of the original performance.

I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts on whether this idea seems technically viable and if there‚Äôs a market for such a feature in the music or entertainment industries.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37f0f,1gmlpbq,My app made $1000 over 8 months with 4k active users - should I keep going or call it a day?,"Hi Guys, I'm looking for some genuine feedback on the viability of my app.

Here are the key details:

**Background:**

* Launched the app about 10 months ago on both iOS and Android
* Around 40k users have tried out the app since the launch
* Currently have 4k active monthly users ( that is 10% retention rate?)
* Generated $1000 in revenue over the last 8 months
* I spent around a similar cost in development and tools required to keep the app running and would need to do so again in 4 months to continue my efforts.
* I'm updating it almost daily with new content, so about 1-2 hours of work daily.

**Current Situation:**

* Currently at $20 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
* Getting a max of 100 new daily installs :)
* Struggling to improve user retention, Fix ASO, Market, and monetize.

**My Question:** Given these metrics, what would you do if you were in my place? Should I continue trying to grow and improve the app, or best to discontinue it and call this a failed startup and move on to something new?

I'm really passionate about this app and what I do for it, but the low revenue and retention numbers have me doubting whether it's worth further investment of my time and money. considering I am not able to get it organic reach and visibility I think it deserves.

p.s. Apps in this category have the potential to reach thousands in MRR with even lower-quality content. So I'm not sure if I'm just facing temporary challenges or if this is a lost cause.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37dfd,1gvj8f5,Quickly estimating the value of your startup equity,"Please, please, please... make sure you understand the potential value of your equity, whether you're currently employed at a startup or evaluating an offer letter. Here's a quick way to estimate your equity:

1. **Estimate acquisition price (ARR x exit multiples)**
   * Look up industry multiples. For B2B SaaS companies, typical exit multiples might be:
      * Low end: 5√ó ARR
      * Average: 10√ó ARR
      * Good: 15√ó ARR
      * Best-in-class: 20‚Äì25√ó ARR (often through strategic acquisitions)
2. **Make an acquisition fee assumption**
   * Assume 10% in fees. This covers costs like investment banking, due diligence, legal, and consulting fees. So, 10% will come off the top of the acquisition price
3. **Look up equity capital raised**
   * Equity capital raised is typically preferred equity, which gets paid back at sale to preferred shareholders (investors) before common shareholders see proceeds. This can be typically found online on Crunchbase or by adding up all the funding rounds
4. **Determine your equity ownership**
   * Divide your shares by the total fully diluted shares outstanding. Note: You likely do not have direct access to the cap table, but it is appropriate to ask for the # of shares outstanding when receiving an offer. If your a current employee, ask someone with access.
5. **Calculate your cost to exercise**
   * Multiply your shares by your strike price(s). This is what you'll pay to exercise your stock options. Note: I wont be discussing this in the post, but be mindful of AMT tax implications on the delta between the FMV and strike
6. **Determine net gain or loss on equity**
   * Equity value = (((Acquisition Price √ó (1 - Acquisition Fee %)) - Capital Raised) √ó Your Ownership %) - Cost to Exercise

**Let's take a look at an example for B2B SaaS**

Details

* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $20 million
* Potential Exit Multiples: 5√ó, 10√ó, and 15√ó ARR
* Acquisition Fees: 10% of acquisition price
* Capital Raised: $80 million
* Total Shares Outstanding (Fully Diluted): 40 million shares
* Your Shares: 175,000 shares
* Your Ownership Percentage: 175,000 / 40,000,000 =0 .4375%
* Strike Price per Share: $1.25
* Cost to Exercise: 175,000¬†shares √ó $1.25 = $218,750

Calculation (for 10x multiple estimate)

It felt like there were two paths: either jumping on the entrepreneur path that was all over Instagram, or being the ""good kid"" heading to university.

I thought... screw it, why pick? Started working on a startup while doing uni.

First startup? Complete flop. But hey, failed fast and tried again. Second time was different - built an AI Web Design platform by myself and somehow managed to grow it to 8k users in just 3 months. Ended up selling it for $12k. Not life-changing money for most people here, but for an 18-year-old who had never seen more than a few hundred bucks? Mind-blowing.

That exit opened some crazy doors. Now I'm working at another startup that's like my old one on steroids in a team of 20 absolute killers.

Best part? All doors are open. Could start another company, keep learning from my current team, or jump to something new. Sky's the limit. (but for now I'm definitely staying where I am)

I want it to be affordable - around $299 per month; something most companies would just subscribe to because there are no long term contracts.

I‚Äôve found that startups don‚Äôt want to hire someone for this role because it's something the CEO typically takes on themselves.¬†

Small businesses, however, need this role, but they have trouble filling it; they too fall into the category of not having enough resources to allocate for an Operations position.¬†

This ends with small businesses running inefficient ops ‚Äì ones riddled with ‚Äúhurry‚Äù and ‚Äúflying by the seat of their pants.‚Äù

Business owners don‚Äôt link operations and growth together either because they got to where they are today without having to.

Them leaning on a ‚Äúthis is the way we have always done things‚Äù mentality also stunts opportunity.

Businesses are not focused on the right things‚Äìlike growth and the what the future may look like‚Äìbecause they are too occupied with day-today operations that are inefficient.

They are also leaving money on the table by ignoring quality (having to do work twice) and they posses a ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù mindset instead of a ‚Äúproactive‚Äù one.¬†

All three of these (and there are plenty of others) lead to burnout and stress.

I am brainstorming a two-fold solution.

First, there are plenty of workers out there with the same mindset of continuously getting work done faster and better out there, they just aren‚Äôt connected with small businesses.

Companies simply don‚Äôt know how and where to find them unless they fall into their lap or walk into the door (like my personal situation).¬†

If a small business had access to this talent at a low price, would they be at least interested in trying it out for one or two months?

I would want to connect this talent, as I believe it could at minimum expose a company to its various inefficiencies.¬†

Secondly, since hiring people is expensive and time consuming, would a streamlined approach to operations that equips business leaders with the tools they need to improve operations be impactful? Is it even important?

I would like to provide a product/service (not just training) that integrates an Operations mind into a company's day-to-day and long term goals.¬†

I've been developing a platform that connects homeowners with local home improvement professionals (to put it in simple terms.) While running Google Ads campaigns generates good engagement from homeowners (demand side), my organic search traffic is nearly nonexistent - probably because of the SEO issues that I'm currently fixing.

The problem is that this paid acquisition strategy isn't sustainable yet, since I don't have enough professionals (supply side) on the platform. I'm charging professionals for leads, but without sufficient demand, it's hard to demonstrate value to professionals and convince them to join the platform.

I already invited a colleague that works with UI/UX. Also will be working part time and no salary.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37faf,1gh8jgu,Are my expectations too high for a startup? ,"I've been working at my current job two years now. I left an existing company to help my boss start a new company.  We officially opened for business on the day I started my job. 

My complaints consist of: me not having an official title, my bosses unwillingness to become any sort of organized, all of our work having to come through me 1st due to my boss not wanting to pay for anyone else to have access to our software, I feel like often ppl are just waiting around on me because i'm crammed full of tasks that are more important than things like providing a cross reference part number for inventory, communication is never consistent, my boss likes to tell people important things verbally, he will randomly send an email or text, but it's never over one platform for easier documentation, he'll verbally tell our team something important that needs to get done, but because he's so overwhelmed with so many things, or won't get off of his phone to focus because he wants to be on call 24/7 for customers, it's completely incorrect information resulting in everyone else working harder &amp; unproductively on unimportant tasks, he consistently questions everything i'm doing as if he doesn't trust me, recently I needed to share something to our company drop-box &amp; I didn't have the admin permission to do it, not only did he deny me admin access to complete this task, but he also refused to attempt to add the documentations to the drop-box that I was unable to, these are just examples of things that happen often, unfortunately. 

My responsibilities are:

Create PO's for Vendors, Create Jobs in our system for customers, print packing lists, receive packages in the system, create invoices for customers, input &amp; pay invoices for vendors. Keep products stocked, pull orders, maintain correct inventory in system, book freight pickup, answer phone calls, send order confirmations, ect. I wear just about every hat possible here.

  
I guess, I just want to know if this is normal &amp; should I expect it to get better? 

There's no denying that we've been successful. My boss is amazing at sales. We're on the verge of being booked &amp; busy for the next 2 years. However, I feel like i'm fighting an uphill battle because the way my boss sees it is, he knew how to do everything &amp; was able to function ""fine"", so why should it change? None of our team can function this way. We're trying to improve now, but it's hard when resources are limited &amp; our boss complains about things like us organizing inventory, or pushes back on every single thing. It was a fight just to get inventory shelves. 

I feel if I was compensated more, it may all be worth it. But as of right now, i'm making $18 an hour with no benefits other than a week of sick time. Even if I needed insurance I wouldn't be able to afford it after bills. I just feel like it's not fair when i'm writing checks for my manager &amp; his business partner that are sometimes $25k in 2 months. 

  
Maybe i'm a whiner &amp; not meant for this kind of work? But I feel there is an awful lot being asked of me for a paycheck that I could make working at a gas station doing mindless labor.

What attracted you to working at a startup in the first place? \n\nThere is a very big difference between what you‚Äôre doing and working at a gas station from a learning perspective right? It sounds to me like you‚Äôre essentially a key administrator in the company. How much time do you spend talking to customers? Are you in any meetings where deals are being negotiated? Are you involved in figuring out pricing? Do you help with hiring? All of these things, including the admin and orchestration you are doing, are training you in how to run a business.

An example in your boss‚Äô case, as you describe him, would be sales. Do you have any specific areas of expertise which can combine with your skills as a generalist? Just something to think about.\n\nUltimately what I‚Äôm saying is figure out where you want to be first and work backwards from there. If this current job isn‚Äôt heading you in the right direction, then leave. The advantage of a startup is that you get to see and be part of the entire process, where at a giant org you‚Äôre generally working on one small piece. If that interests you then stick to it.

But keep an eye out for this. If they\'re not growing and adjusting, tough road ahead. Also - are they taking a good paycheck while you\'re not? If so, warning sign. They ought to be the last one to be paid well (IMO, a founder), because they own most of the company and should be putting their people first because they know that, without you, things won\'t work.\n\nYou\'re not a ""whiner,"" there\'s no shame in wanting something better if this sucks.', '**Options** \n\n* Quit \n* Ask for more money. \n* Ask for help \n* Steal money \n* Shut up and take it']"

I'm currently researching how early-stage startups keep up with the endless stream of opportunities like grants, accelerators, and hackathons that pop up throughout the year. From what I've gathered, it seems like many founders feel overwhelmed or worry about missing deadlines for key applications.

For those of you who have been in this situation, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences:

* **How do you currently find and track these kinds of events?** (specific tools, websites, or communities you rely on)
* **Do you ever feel like you miss out on important opportunities because of timing or lack of information?**
* **If there were a way to receive regular alerts or updates tailored to your startup‚Äôs stage or sector, would that be helpful?**

P.S: here is the feedback that I already got from some of my friends (from India):  
1. Hire interns explicitly for this job - they keep searching for the relevant info on the internet and share that with the management.  
2. Have a calendar of events and look for that.  
3. Get information from incubators and WhatsApp/Discord/Telegram groups

Even if your current method is same, please let me know.

Any insights you share would be really valuable for understanding this space better, and I think it could help a lot of us brainstorm better ways to streamline the discovery process.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fbe,1ggygqk,CTO or founding engineer US -&gt; EU -- am I wildly off-base?,"I am a PhD MBA candidate at a top university in aerospace graduating spring 2025 with an offer for $230k/y sal + $70k/yr equity with SpaceX or $275k at a defense tech growth-stage startup with some equity I'm not sure.

I've recently been contacted by an EU foreign national to build X product to help Ukraine, something I certainly believe in. This is my bread-and-butter, unlike SpaceX (but the other company is similar). He mentioned in his first email that he was looking for a founding controls engineer, but when he saw my background he decided he was **considering co-founder**. He has great credentials

He says **he put in $250k** and has a product that looks good, and I think his idea is very good--I believe in the idea, but has significant amounts of technical debt. **He says his traction is a LOI** with the Ukrainian military and soldiers who want the device. I do not believe he can close the design and get the product to do all of X correctly by himself (probably can get it to do half of X), he's currently using hobby components, but he knows he will have to get serious about those things in the future. **He says he plans to raise $1.5 mil VC but no specific timeline or valuation**. On his slides, he says 50% of that will be for salaries. He does not seem to be working on the product, he mainly seems to be evaluating sites to build production later on, the complex physical product doesn't seem to have changed much in 6 months, but part of the software is getting better.

We spoke briefly and I passed a long series of technical checks with people he trusts, including people who build products similar to his. He threw out an offer of **15% + CTO + unspecified salary + move to UK or eastern Europe**, and we kind of mutually talked about about being lean as a founder on salary when you believe in the mission. It was kind of a spur of the moment ""gut check"" thing his father told him to do. I thanked him for the offer, told him I would consider it, and spoke with founders and staff here at my college to understand the offer and decide if it's worth it.

Basically everyone I talked to said that what should be worth it for me would be 25%-30% + CTO + salary at 60% of my market rate. I decided, I guess for no reason, but to be nice to my potential founder and shot for 25% + CTO + cost of living + 60k salary, or an offer that was 25% + CTO + salary of 50% market or $150k. (I gave the COL offer because he's deciding whether or not to place the HQ in the UK or eastern European nations). I told him that basically, you know, founding a company is about trust and candor, so that's what I was thinking but I was very open to talking about it and seeing if we can reach a compromise. I basically targeted 25% 150k because **I was fine with 25% + $120k post-negotiation salary** or even lower but we would have to get into pro-forma to justify.

I personally feel this is really fair for a ""gut check"" move across the world to join a startup with no complete product, no sales, and no raised funds besides his initial $250k. Equity-wise, I'm probably going to be deflated by the time we launch the first product, and there's so many market risks with the war in Ukraine.

Not so to the potential cofounder. He said he and his other employee, someone on at \~5%, are taking salaries of only $30k and he says that I have to weigh the mission--which I believe in--vs the better compensation of SpaceX, and he won't be able to get near SpaceX. He also mentioned he is reconsidering me for the CTO role because he's more worried about manufacture (downshift to founding engineer). He wants me to be involved with his team at a **low salary of $30k and no stated equity to see how we work together** (?) before making a vesting schedule and actually agreeing on equity.

I basically told him that I wouldn't quit my PhD/MBA for that, nor move. You know, am I crazy? He is aware of cliffs and vesting, why doesn't he do that? I feel like, if we're successful, he's going to make a chunk of change, I'm going to make a little, and it's going to be very worth it for him, not so worth it for me.

I basically said a CTO is a powerhouse all-star that can build the product without you in the loop if needed, e.g. when fundraising, and if I can't do that he fires me. Is that just America? Are the salaries that crazy different that $30k @ 15% is reasonable for a CTO to move across the world? I understand he put $250k in, but if I'm not getting any of it, why am I not at like 40-45%?

TL;DR: Foreign co-founder has a half-product that I (PhD/MBA) can close, and wants me to move to his location and develop a product at 15% equity, $30k salary, when I have a great SpaceX offer. I like the startup space more and am highly motivated about the mission.",71,startups,1730439092.0,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ggygqk/cto_or_founding_engineer_us_eu_am_i_wildly_offbase/,question,"[""Take the space X gig.

Maybe if he commits to pay raises pending his next round. Your offer of 22%/120k is super fair from a negotiation standpoint IMHO, especially given your other offer(s). OTOH 120k is half of their 250k resources, which is unfair to him. The 15% initial offer seems like a low-ball, though.\n\nSalaries are definitely lower in the EU in general\n\nA LOI is normally nothing - fairy dust. Nice to look at but has no substance. B2G is normally brutal due to the glacial pace that governments work at and all their procurement rules/processes.

But if you really want to follow your heart and do something crazy, there's room to finesse the negotiations and work something out that isn't a scam for either of you.

His current offer is too low on both. Push him a bit to work on and seal his round. If he can say 'hot shot PHD under contract will be joining as CTO,' that's a good indicator to investors.\n\nIf he says no, he's basically firing you, so you should get some severance or additional compensation if he ends up selling your design/work. I'd think about a royalty, % up to a total sales value that might be acheivable in the first year or two. e.g. 5%, up to a max of 100k from the first $2 million in sales. You'd expect their product to evolve, so something super long term wouldn't be fair.\n\nIf you say no, similar situation, but you should probably ask for less in future earnings/royalty, since you're dipping out.\n\nMaybe ask around in your program. There are probably some profs/advisors with both startup and negotiation experience, right?

**Document your journey.**

It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you‚Äôre working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here‚Äôs why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you‚Äôre deep in the grind, it‚Äôs easy to forget how far you‚Äôve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you‚Äôve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I‚Äôve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I‚Äôve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I‚Äôm bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I‚Äôve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It‚Äôs one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you‚Äôre just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you‚Äôre doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you‚Äôre not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I‚Äôve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

**Don‚Äôt wait. Start documenting today, even if it‚Äôs just for yourself, you‚Äôll thank yourself later.**",24,startups,1733433519.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7k5e0/what_i_wish_i_did_sooner_as_a_new_founder_advice/,experience,['good advice.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d7b,1gztylp,Typical Chicken or The Egg Dilemma,"Hey guys,

My co founders and I just launched our MVP platform a couple weeks ago which acts like a job aggregator for healthcare clinicians for specific jobs that are starting to be offered by hospitals right now. The current/traditional way of finding these is through a staffing agency but that means less pay for clinicians and more premium costs for employers. Our goal is to make that connection directly without the need for a middle-man.

We wouldnt get one type of user without the other so we scraped a bunch of these jobs for clinicians to view and request to apply to for free and got a little bit of traction but were struggling to get traction and in touch with the right people on the hospital side to work with us or at least provide some feedback. We know for a 100% fact they would benefit from this product though from past jobs but if it takes too long we dont want it to jeopardize our current users.

Anyone have any tips for navigating the traditional ""which comes first, chicken or the egg"" scenario for a startup? We really want to try to focus on one to hopefully make it easier to get the other.

What we've seen:

Our company wwwdotanother-fucking-saasdotcom

we've gotten emails from people asking if the job offers are real, coming from domains like

wwwdotanother-fucking-saasdotshop

wwwdotanother-fucking-saas-hiringdotbiz

etc

The obvious thing to do is buy as many TLD's as we can, but SLD's we're just kinda shit outta luck. Any time we see another TLD sending emails I write to the domain provider and they shut it down pretty quickly, but it's fucking whack-a-mole.

The part that I really don't know HOW to manage though, is the linkedin and google mail spam. People are catfishing/impersonating our real employees and sending job offers to people.

Unfortunately, I'm the closest thing to IT that we have...since I'm building the product, I'm the 'computer guy'. I'm OK doing this, but unfortunately I don't actually know WHAT to do. I reached out to an old CTO and he said to buy every TLD under the sun, so check there I guess.

But, as far as Linkedin, general catfishing, is there ANYTHING we can do other than ignore it all? I'm worried it's making us look bad. How common is this with other growing startups/businesses? Are we just unlucky? Or is this just what happens at this stage?

","Hi Redditors,

**About Me:**

I'm an architect, 3D artist, and AI enthusiast based in Hungary with a vision to create innovative tools for the architecture and 3D art industries. I've already started a project aimed at enhancing workflows for professionals in these fields. While there are many tools out there, the quality and efficiency of my workflows offer a significant advantage.

i have deep industry knowledge, clear vision for growth and marketing strategies. I've attached my website and project screenshots also so you know i am really pushing hard i work full time but i work on my side projects on weekends and after working hours .

My skills :

1-3d art /architecture/music production (expert)

2-Comfyui /AI workflows (expert)

3-webdesign (i can build any website not an expert but good as you can see)

4-sales and marketing (Learning and my main goal is to be one of the best marketers that's why i need some one with me i have lots of creative project ideas and i think if you are persistent enough we can go big either in the AI space or the XR space or both there is lots of opportunities right now)

5- Programming (beginner i started this project 4-5 months ago i used a purepython framework but i think it can do the job if we can deliver the mvp , do sales marketing and then if it goes big we can do it in next.js it seemed easy to me and we can use the existing code as fastapi end points already)

mvp wip screenshots : this is working locally right now but i think the main structure is set already i need someone who can deliver this to the cloud also and make it work seamlessly there are some minor bugs in the ui but it can be solved easily:

i will post thin in comments

**What I'm Looking For:**

I'm seeking a generalist technical person to join me as a co-founder on a 50/50 basis. You should be willing to put in the effort, open to learning, and capable of developing the MVP with me. Although I'm based in Hungary, I'm open to collaborating remotely if it's a good fit.

what i want from you :

1-be able to assemble general saas functions (payment , docker , databse etc) , and basically do everything technically i will be with you so you can tell me what to do as i am a beginner but i can help ,at the end i will be responsible for sales marketing and content etc i will just be with you as a helping hand to deliver very fast..

I've noticed a common theme here: many of us are pouring so much energy into developing our products and growing our teams that creating consistent, engaging content becomes a bit of a backburner task. I mean, let‚Äôs be real‚Äîbetween pitching, managing cash flow, and trying to keep up with everything else, content might be the last thing we want to think about.

Yet, we all know how powerful good content can be for growth. It can build brand authority, improve visibility, and keep potential customers engaged. But let‚Äôs face it‚Äîdoing it right is tough. It‚Äôs not just about *writing* content; it‚Äôs about writing content that resonates, drives value, and aligns with the brand voice.

* Relying on someone in-house to ""wear many hats"" and handle content part-time?
* Trying to do it all yourself?
* Considering outsourcing or already working with freelancers/agencies?

The reason behind these games are:

1. Doesn't require any kind of maintenance, just cloud flare is good enough to handle everything. Games are of few kbs (just html file)

2. Pretty simple to implement (with right prompt and few tweaks in the code, will be able to generate these games) 

3. Open source it because technically I haven't put in my mind / much effort to build something of my own. So open sourcing makes sense so that it will benefit other developers in case they want to reuse in their web / app.

Question:

1. This is not the standard way of business, this is fun side project. I am not sure how should I proceed ahead. I should go ahead and build few games and keep it live? 

2. If I want to monetize this, what are the different ways to earn money out of it apart from ads? I am not a game developer and frankly I am not confident that I will be able to develop something which will make the players feel wow.

A year ago, I partnered with someone on a startup. She brought the idea, and I built the app and website entirely myself. We agreed on a 50/50 split. Over the past year, I‚Äôve created a much better version and put in significantly more time and effort. We‚Äôve attracted interest from two major B2B prospects, which feels like great progress.

However, things have gone south recently. She hired a lawyer to incorporate the company and now says 50/50 isn‚Äôt fair. She wants to reduce my share to 25%, even though she admits I‚Äôve contributed more and am responsible for the technical success so far.

There are other frustrations, too:

She‚Äôs unhappy with a few bugs and said that as CTO, I‚Äôm responsible for UX as well. I was expecting her to define how users interact with the product, but when I said I‚Äôd need to code less to focus on research and customer conversations, she said that‚Äôs not her problem.

My laptop broke yesterday, and I need $2K(or 5 for a new) for a replacement to keep developing. She said it‚Äôs my issue to solve, just like hosting and subscription costs, which I‚Äôve been covering alone.


From my perspective, it feels unfair to continue this alone or even bring in a new CEO, though one person has already expressed interest in stepping into that role.

I‚Äôm okay cutting my losses if necessary. However, we have two product demos scheduled next week with potential new customers, and I feel like the trust is completely gone. I‚Äôm unsure what to do with the data and code if I leave.

Launched my SaaS today (Video Generator) and made almost every mistake a first time founder makes.

Some learnings and mistakes to save you the suffering.

**1. Don't be Fake steve jobs:**

Fake steve jobs : I am the best, I am a product god, screw the users and customers. I will build and they will come.

Real steve jobs : I will build a shitty version first (iphone) and then iterate on it every year

**2. It's not about 1 big launch**

It's about setting up a fun and non frustrating shipping process. You ship and experiment every week. This takes time to understand but please add this in.

**3. If you're a tech product- either get a CTO or a good founding engineer**

As a tech product you need a strong engineer to iterate very quickly. Timing is important and you need to move fast in crowded markets. 

We're currently strugging with this.

4. Please do Pre-sales. For the love¬†**of god.**

Validate the ""problem"" you're solving. Your product is just a solution for the problem. Set up a landing page. Slap on a payment page. Run ads. See if you get 50-100$. Validate it. Don't build and spend 10K$ on a solution that doesn't solve a problem.

5\*\*. Launch the smallest version first\*\*

This will feel uncomfortable - and it;s good! Launch something so small and tiny first and keep building on top of it.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cba,1h6r9vv,First 100 users for my app in a couple of weeks -Lessons learned so far,"It‚Äôs incredibly exciting to hit my first 100 users, and I‚Äôm especially proud because I did it without any paid advertising! Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I‚Äôve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You‚Äôre Solving** It‚Äôs easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else‚Äîfundraising, branding, or scaling‚Äîcomes second to making sure you‚Äôre solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I‚Äôve been building this while working a 9‚Äì5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You‚Äôre More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you‚Äôll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It‚Äôs tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup‚Äîbranding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you‚Äôre not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it‚Äôs worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

I would be interested in your opinion and experience in customer acquisition. I have developed the MVP for a resale platform where you can buy and sell tickets for concerts.

Like everyone else, I was looking for a technical founder but couldn't find myself a match so I went for the no code development on my own and built a MVP with bubble io 

I launched it last year and now I have about 6k users with daily active users 600-700 and I'm looking at a pattern of growth. 6 months ago, I had about 470ish users but now they are growing fast.

Its an app in a certain niche so I don't expect it go much high but still the community is growing. 

Here's the issue which I am facing:

My costs are escalating for Bubble and my WUs have passed 1.5 million, and now I am close to getting billed in 1k on monthly basis. On top of that, I want to do something with the app which I can't do technically. 

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

I also received quotations from 5 agencies more and it was around 35-65k USD and on top of that a maintenance and support contract.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e16,1gukuuk,"Focus on the problem, not the solution
","One of the biggest misconceptions that I‚Äôve seen with founders on their pitches is around focusing on the problem vs. the solution.

Especially with the advent of GenAI, I started to notice that 8/10 pitches mentioned a lot more about the solution than the problem.¬†

I would hear from founders how AI would be used to do these cool things, but there was very little talk about how it was solving the actual problem in depth - it became a bad habit.

Side note: AI fatigue is real.

The best pitches I‚Äôve seen are the ones that can strike a good balance between both, but they‚Äôre also the ones that have a higher probability of long-term success.¬†

Let‚Äôs talk about a few reasons why this is so important‚Ä¶

‚Äî

Solutions (i.e. the product) change at a faster rate than the problem - you‚Äôre building, testing, and iterating much more quickly. This is because of customer feedback and new insights along your product journey. It‚Äôs not unnatural to pivot multiple times.

The \*problem\* however is much more rigid, and less likely to change (but there are exceptions!)

Ideally, the natural path to take is to identify a core problem, and then find a solution around it. What you don‚Äôt want to do is the reverse.¬†

I‚Äôve seen examples of founders trying to mold a problem to fit their solution.¬†

You can end up building something irrelevant consuming huge amounts of time, money, and resources into solving a particular problem that should have never existed.¬†

But how do you know when a problem needs fixing?¬†

That‚Äôs when it becomes unique to the founder. Those who are obsessed with the problem are usually the ones who can go the furthest.¬†

The problem needs to bother you A LOT.¬†

It‚Äôs when obsession takes over.

It needs to get under your skin and create discomfort for you to the point where you can‚Äôt get it off your mind.¬†

The great thing about this approach is that this type of relentlessness will take you down a rabbit hole you actually want to go down.¬†

If the problem matters to you enough, eventually you become fully immersed and relentless in understanding \*why\* the problem exists and matters to you.

It means that the best problems to solve are also the ones worth solving but hidden in plain sight.

The plus side is that those who stay problem-focused unlock insights that their competitors miss.

But problems that could be solved don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum - it needs a solution.¬†

So going back to the pitches:

As mentioned previously, the most memorable pitches are the ones that can do the balancing act between problem and solution, but they also tell a great story about the problem and why it needs addressing.

They then use the problem as a segue into their solution.

But in many cases, the solution itself can convey a ‚Äòset-in-stone‚Äô perspective of what the company is (or will be) doing.¬†

However, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.

The solution presented in the deck could change a number of times.¬†

The reality is that it‚Äôs not about having THE solution, but it‚Äôs having A solution, especially at such an early stage.

Any thoughtful solution to a worthwhile problem is worth building.¬†

The goal is to get your initial solution in the hands of your ideal customer as quickly as possible and iterate from there.

It‚Äôs about finding what works and if the solution is truly addressing the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve.

You‚Äôre not going to get it right the first time, so it‚Äôs best to build early and deploy fast.

Over time, you‚Äôll refine the solution and have a much better understanding of the problem. This will then feed back into the investment deck, and all the branding and marketing materials that come with it.

Ultimately, the companies and brands that have longevity are the ones who are completely locked into the problem they want to solve. They understand the problem intimately, better than anyone else, and also have the capabilities to solve it.",10,startups,1731977845.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gukuuk/focus_on_the_problem_not_the_solution/,experience,"['Such a great reminder to focus on the problem first!

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e94,1gqhcgg,I'm going crazy,"Hello. I am a 22-year-old co-founder of Desi Discoveries, a startup that invites foreigners to experience Indian weddings to showcase and promote our cultural heritage. My co-founder is my boyfriend, who is skilled in design, legal matters, and negotiation. This was one of the main reasons I started the company with him.

In the beginning, everything was running smoothly for the first 1-2 months. However, he then mentioned that he had upcoming college exams and couldn‚Äôt contribute for two weeks. I understood and managed the workload on my own. But now, it has been four months, and he hasn‚Äôt taken any significant initiatives or contributed to the work.

For the past three months, I have been asking him to open the company bank account, but it hasn‚Äôt been done. Although I lacked design skills, I redesigned the website by myself. He hasn‚Äôt helped generate leads or reached out to potential clients. Apart from setting up the initial base of the site in the first two months, he hasn‚Äôt made any further contributions.

I took on cold calling and cold messaging 30-50 people daily for an entire month, which led to securing 64 wedding opportunities. This industry is untapped, and some industry insiders even found our idea unusual and responded rudely. After his initial negative experience with a call, he refused to reach out to anyone again. (his communication is way better than me, and it was a challenge to deal with people on call)

Now, we need to redo much of the work, ifor finding foreigners. However, I have an important exam coming up in 10 days, which is imp for me. I‚Äôve been asking him to take the initiative and shoulder some responsibilities, but he responds me saying that I only care about work and often argues with me. Despite balancing our personal relationship with dates and celebrations, I end up doing all the work to avoid conflicts and maintain our relationship.

It‚Äôs challenging to manage both my studies and the startup, especially since our idea is unconventional. I feel torn because if I don‚Äôt continue working hard, the past few months‚Äô efforts will be wasted.

Sometimes it means that I can work till the night. Always work on evenings, weekends, and every day. Only because I want it, my family needs it, and because it is who I am. Yeah, sure, 9-5 pay the bills right now.

But my side hustle is the future. I get up on the weekends without alarms and just enjoy working on my thing. Especially when my business makes money, it feels great. It gives more power, freedom, and joy.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP is also hard. Because you literally can build things without knowing will be you paid for that. Or is it the right thing to do ? A lot of doubts, sleepless nights in my mind. One thing is for sure: it is all worth it. Yeah, you have a big chance to get nothing in the end.

But one thing you won't regret is that you did it. It is hard to predict whether it is your success or not. Is it your thing or not?

One thing I know for sure, more you try, more chances you get. Because all we need is 1 win from 100 attempts. One win will change your life fully. You won't be the same.

I\'ve not been successful in any of my endeavours (then again, my measure of success could differ from others) and there have been a lot of moments lately where I\'m questioning myself. I recently came into some money through an inheritance and I\'m going all in on the project I\'m currently working on where it\'s my make or break. Issues I\'ve encountered or I\'m encountering:  \n  \n\\- The biggest one: I\'m not a technical guy. My background is marketing, operations and management. Finding a technical co-founder has been the most daunting task.  \n\\- I live in a country where tech, startups and generally the entrepreneurship community is not the best. (Canada. In case any of you are wondering).  \n\\- I have guilt...a lot of it. My wife is the breadwinner now and she absolutely believes in me and what my project is, to which she\'s working extra hard to make ends meet so that I can focus on the startup. Seeing her work into early mornings and how tired she is on weekends breaks my heart.  \n\\- Imposter syndrome: I see some of what you guys are doing and it\'s really impressive. Then I get inspired, go try and build a landing page and it\'s ass. I then ask myself: if I can\'t even build a landing page, how the fuck am I going to build my platform? (It\'s somewhat of a freelancer marketplace but with AI features. Think Uber Eats but for small tasks). Then there\'s self-doubt with skills, capability, financial literacy and many more which I\'m not even going to bother as it\'s a totally different story.  \n\\- Focus. This is a huge one. Coming from a career running marketing and digital experiences for some of the biggest brands and agencies in the world (not to brag but chances are, you have something in your house or used to have that I did their marketing for), I was operating at 1000 miles per hour. Now I\'m on my own, there are moments where I\'m struggling to maintain the momentum and find myself gaming for an hour which results in anxiety. I think to myself ""That hour gaming could have been spent on research or something that contributes to the success of my startup"". It\'s a very tough feeling to navigate through as it often ends up in me getting anxiety.\n\nSo to anyone out there thinking of running a startup or even wanting to embark on entrepreneurship, hopefully my post here can give some insight. The image of running a successful business, being the next Ivan Zhao or Dylan Field, is something that only happens very rarely.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fa1,1ghp3h4,"Revolutionize the Ready-Made Garment Industry, is this possible with tech ?","Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the challenges in the RMG sector:

# Key Industry Pain Points

1. **Unorganized &amp; Fragmented System:**
   * **For Buyers**: Small to mid-sized brands struggle to find reliable factories for production. There's no streamlined, efficient way to partner with manufacturers.
   * **For Manufacturers**: Sourcing raw materials and finding dependable vendors is chaotic, making it hard to maintain agile operations.
2. **Lack of Transparency:**
   * The supply chain is riddled with face-to-face deals, intermediaries, and backdoor agreements.
   * Gaining business often depends on personal relationships or agents, creating barriers for new players without connections.
3. **Inefficient Marketplaces:**
   * Current platforms like IndiaMart are not specialized for the RMG sector. The presence of several intermediaries increases costs, sometimes forcing factories to use unsustainable practices to remain competitive.
   * Efficiently connecting with a trustworthy factory or vendor is nearly impossible without middlemen, leading to inflated prices.
4. **Unreliable B2B Solutions:**
   * Existing platforms aren‚Äôt built for the RMG sector‚Äôs complex requirements, such as costing, MOQ management, design communication, and payment/shipping terms.
   * There‚Äôs no reliable B2B payment and shipping system tailored for the industry. Moreover, suppliers often request credit terms, and there‚Äôs no mechanism to assess their financial reliability or ensure payment.
5. **Limited Customization Options in POD (Print-On-Demand):**
   * POD platforms offer minimal customization, leading to generic products with no real differentiation beyond simple prints.

I would like to create a end-to-end digital platform for RMG production. The place where my factory is located is home to 10,000 factories of knitwear RMG. The amount of potential for this is huge, given the nature of unorganization in this industry. The apparel landscape is shifting to agile &amp; sustainable production from mass production, the nature of the industry allows low entry barriers for brands to be established but the problem relies on making a strong / resilient supply chain.

I‚Äôve been dreaming of starting a startup for a while now. I even have some good ideas. But every time I think about starting, I feel stuck. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to do it ‚Äì I do! But some common problems keep holding me back.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm dealing with:

* **Where to start?** Sometimes I feel excited about the idea, but when it comes to taking action, it feels boring or overwhelming. Like, I don‚Äôt know what to do next.
* **No domain knowledge:** I know tech stuff, but when it comes to business things like marketing, finance, or even running a company, I‚Äôm clueless.
* **Money issues:** This is a big one. I know how to build things, but using cloud services and tools costs so much. Every time I think about the charges, it feels like my dream is slipping away.

It‚Äôs hard, honestly. I know I‚Äôm not lazy, but I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in the same place. It‚Äôs frustrating because I want to move forward, but I don‚Äôt know how to solve these problems.

Are any of you going through the same thing? Or have you been here before and found a way out? I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences, advice, or even just some encouragement.

You could launch something and it's only by engaging with customers that you find out the deeper problems that have broader market potential. This is where the business model comes in.

After taking to many potential customers and market research I launched my website called PostPilot which may be you think another AI product or social media management tool but I think it is different and maybe I don't think there is any product like this in a  market which can fully automate content creation for your business.

PostPilot works in 3 simple steps:
1. Select template from wide range of templates available on our website (and trust me quality of template is best)
2. Describe your content preference 
3. Select timeing 

And all done now we will daily create and upload content on your account so you can focus on doing something great.

Maybe you think there is already tool like this in market some famous one are Buffer and SocialBee but PostPilot is different it's a fully automation tool from creating content to uploading on your account and I can assure it will be not like some typical AI generate content it will be good and genuine. 

We focus on small businesses and new start-ups whose main focus is to build business and save money on hiring big content creators so they can leave content creation to us.

You know that feeling, right ? Me too. 

We missed one important step before building anything - ASKING. We need to ask more clients, users, and do our research based on Google Keywords, forums and subreddits. 

You probably won't do it. It is your choice. You have all rights to do it. Let me give one piece of advice, instead of building more features and spendings months on your MVP.

Set a deadline in 2-4 weeks. Build it, launch it, and go live as soon as possible. You need to get a real feedback and face a reality.

Each employee who were to fill in this questionnaire and do one 10-15 minute exercise a week were offered a free lunch or they can leave 30 mins early each Friday, the company would have every single employee engaging with the platform.\n\nThe psychological factor of letting people leave 30 mins early each Friday is quite interesting because most people would do their daily job anyway, the same amount they would do in 8 hours, they would now do in 7,5 hours and they would still regard this 30 mins as a big bonus.\n\nNow that\'s a platform what would work.\n\nThere\'s so many problems that companies and government try to solve with huge amounts of money instead of using easy and obvious psychological tricks that don\'t cost anything or next to anything, I could give so many examples....""\n\n  \nOne major factor that I see MOST Digital Products overlook is basic human psychology.

Receptionist To Local or Service Based Businesses!,"Hey entrepreneurs, if you are looking for a startup idea or even just to make some extra money each month, need extra money for Christmas, or if you are looking to start your side hustle then this is a easy strategy to get up and going! It's a way to use A.I. to help service businesses stop missing leads and it's easy to scale from home!  This is just one service but a lot of businesses will be able to utilize it!

**The big problem you are helping solve:**¬†It doesn't matter what business it is, if they miss a phone call, it typically results in a lost customer. I actually experienced this personally yesterday. I called a service technician to help fix a issue we had at our house, they didn't answer, went to voicemail, and the mailbox was full. We called the next repair technician!

**The solution:**¬†Provide a software service for businesses that utilizes a friendly Voice A.I Receptionist to answer the calls and take down the customers info for a call back at a later time. I have been training an A.I. receptionist over the last few days and it is incredible how good it is. This is going to be game changing for so many businesses. It's easy to train, easy to setup, and it's easy to sell to other local businesses.

**The Why:**¬†This is perfect if you are looking for a side hustle or even just some extra Christmas money!

here's my current situation: 

\- I've been building a d2c brand since the beginning of the year. it has promise and we're making good progress. i want to stick with it and don't want to give up.

but, with everything in business, it is taking longer than expected to get some of the fundamentals in place, that I believe will put us in a good position to raise investment. so i'm going to keep plugging away with it.

at the same time, we're bootstrapping and I need to generate cashflow for myself.

here's what i've tried:

\- building a cold email consultancy / agency where i help people improve the copy of their cold emails. i've been able to successfully cold email some prolific entrepreneurs like shaan puri, sam parr, andrew wilkinson, sahil bloom and more. have helped two clients with this so far and have made a total of $2k. 

\- i was struggling to get traction beyond this, and so decided to pivot to consulting healthtech startups. I was previously an ops guy at a healthtech startup in london for 3.5 years and helped to scale, and figured I have a lot of experience I can help other healthtech businesses with, as a special projects / chief of staff type consultant. again, not really had much traction with being able to get a client for this.

i'm determined to build something service based alongside my d2c business as i believe it can be a great way to get cashflow and cover my basic expenses. and i need to get something going asap as i'm running out of runway.  
  
what would you do if you were me?

I feel there's something in the cold email agency. i know i'm very good at it and i can help other people. it's already been validated with the money i've already made. i feel maybe my positioning isn't right?

so far, I've only really helped solopreneurs who want to use cold email for their SaaS, but i feel they might not be the right niche given solopreneurs trying to get clients don't really have budget for an agency / consultant.   
  
any ideas on which niche to focus on?   
  
some ideas i have:  
  
\- indian software engineer agencies (i'm indian myself but british indian and my english is strong)  
\- healthtech startups (given my professional background) looking to use cold email for lead gen

For example, is there a general SOM threshold (e.g., $100M, $200M, etc.) that investors find appealing?
	2.	What percentage of SOM should I ideally target to achieve within 5 years for it to be considered a strong and viable investment?
I‚Äôm trying to ensure my 5-year projections align with what VCs typically expect.

Would love to hear from anyone with experience pitching to VCs or those who‚Äôve seen successful healthcare startups in this space. Any advice, benchmarks, or resources would be super helpful!

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37dc7,1gwtbtt,Grew my startup 7x in the last month,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Wanted to share a recent win that might be helpful to others.

Some context: I started a SAAS to solve a simple but critical problem - helping DTC brands keep their customer data longer than the 7-day cookie window that's killing most mobile marketing efforts. We basically help brands implement server-side tracking and better use their first-party data for Meta ads and email marketing.

This means we were sitting on a goldmine of behavioral data (think millions of pre-purchase signals) and didn't even know it. We're the first point of interaction between customers and brands after all! This realization led to spending \~4 mo analyzing trends across our biggest performance wear clients.

What we found was fascinating:

* Cult sports are completely changing how brands succeed
* Traditional marketing playbooks are becoming obsolete
* First-party data is creating massive competitive advantages

And the numbers to back it all up.  
  
I ended up compiling our findings in to a whitepaper and started sharing it exclusively with industry leaders. The response was insane: **7x growth in inbound leads, multiple enterprise brands reaching out, speaking opportunities at industry events**

Key lessons learned:

1. Sometimes your best asset isn't your product, but your position in the market
2. Data without insight is just numbers
3. Sharing knowledge builds more trust than traditional marketing (!!!!!)

My wife and I started a small business recently, and we‚Äôd love some advice. Here‚Äôs the backstory:

We‚Äôve always loved traveling, and every time our friends visit the same destinations as us, they end up saying, *""Oh, I wish I‚Äôd known about that spot!""* or \*""I should have checked with you before planning!""

So, we started creating personalized travel guides for them, filled with our favorite places to visit, eat, and explore. They‚Äôve loved the experience so much that we‚Äôre thinking about taking it online and selling these guides as templates.

Now, we‚Äôre here to ask you all for some honest feedback:

1. Would you ever consider starting a business with your spouse? Is it worth it, or should I go find a lawyer now? üòâ
2. Do you think there‚Äôs genuine interest in this idea from travelers, or is it just our friends being polite?

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur discussing some AI product ideas with potential customers and engineers to get feedback. My goal is to have open and collaborative conversations but also ensure everyone is on the same page regarding roles and expectations.

I want to avoid situations where someone thinks they deserve equity or ownership just for providing input. However, I also really value these relationships and don't want them to sour due to misunderstandings. Protecting the work is important but maintaining trust and goodwill is equally critical.

I'm looking for advice from other founders on how to strike the right balance:

* What's the best way to communicate upfront to avoid incorrect expectations?
* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

My aim is to build strong, productive connections while being transparent. I don't want to be overly guarded but also want to mitigate the risk of misunderstandings that could undermine trust.

When I was starting\xa0[FireChatbot](https://firechatbot.com/), I faced similar concerns about balancing transparency with trust. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:\n\n1. **Be Clear from the Start:**\xa0Set the tone early in the conversation. I‚Äôd say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the early stages of this idea and looking for feedback to help me refine it. Right now, I‚Äôm not looking for formal partnerships, but I really value your insights.‚Äù This helps frame the conversation so there‚Äôs no confusion about roles.\n2. **Use Simple Agreements When Necessary:**\xa0If things get more involved, a friendly NDA can go a long way. It doesn‚Äôt have to be heavy-handed‚Äîjust something to make sure everyone‚Äôs on the same page. It shows you‚Äôre taking things seriously without overcomplicating it.\n3. **Address Contributions Directly:**\xa0If someone is offering a lot of input, I‚Äôd say something like, ‚ÄúYour advice has been so helpful, and I really appreciate it. If we get to a point where formal collaboration makes sense, we can talk about roles and terms then.‚Äù This keeps things open while making boundaries clear.\n4. **Know When to Bring in Legal Help:**\xa0Once someone‚Äôs involvement goes beyond casual feedback‚Äîlike contributing work or resources‚Äîit‚Äôs time to outline things in writing. That‚Äôs when legal agreements around equity or ownership make sense.\n5. **Avoid Ambiguity:**\xa0One thing I learned the hard way is that people generally appreciate clarity, even if it feels awkward upfront. Misunderstandings usually come from things left unsaid, not from being too direct.\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me: people are usually more understanding than you‚Äôd think when you‚Äôre honest and upfront. It‚Äôs much easier to build trust when everyone knows where they stand from the beginning. Good luck‚Äîit sounds like you‚Äôre approaching this with the right mindset!', 'Smart use of ai.

He definitely does not think hes entitled to the 25% i promised him because there were milestones he needed to hit to ensure that the platform was growing.\n\nIf you want to give equity, you need to make a PIP and hold them accountable and essentially get nothing if they do nothing.\n\nSomeone giving you an idea is free, execution is so if someone gives you an idea, compensate them accordingly but dont feel you owe them anything. Ive been given a million good business ideas, but until i actually execute on one, it doesnt matter.\n\nI sent you a pm as well, I hope that I can help out!', ""I've been through this a few times. \n\nNobody's involved until you explicitly invite them to be involved. Discussions, advice, consulting, do not constitute involvement. \n\nThere are four roles: Uninvolved persons, advisors/consultants, employees, and co-founders. \n- Uninvolved persons get nothing. \n- Advisors/consultants get a fraction of a percent subject to specific times and outcomes.

It doesn't matter if it's your idea or you've been working on it longer, yadda yadda nonsense. Equal split with you. \n\nYou introduce legal agreements at the point of a binding commitment. This is typically after you have discussed and verbally agreed to everything. \n\nSpeak plainly. Tell the truth and don't lie. Explain what you want and expect and discuss it throughly.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cbc,1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I‚Äôm a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers‚Äîjust a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we‚Äôd never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here‚Äôs what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki‚Äôs 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you‚Äôre a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it‚Äôs vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it‚Äôs a significant issue worth solving.

I‚Äôd follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I‚Äôd revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails‚Äîno friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* ‚ÄúThis investor will drill into your TAM‚Äîmake sure it‚Äôs airtight.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúAvoid using the term ‚ÄòAI agent‚Äô with these firms.‚Äù

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there‚Äôs one thing I wish someone had told me: Don‚Äôt raise money in the summer.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f47,1gl1l01,3 things I learned about B2B SaaS that you should know if you are building/growing your startup ,"A little bit of context. I'm a growth marketer specialized in **B2B SaaS startups** with over 5 years of experience.

I worked with a lot of different startups, helping them increasing overall growth of the company.

Those are the main critical barriers and mistakes I recognized as a common pattern along the years that you likely want to avoid.

**1. IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO VALIDATE A PRODUCT WITHOUT ACTUALLY BUILDING IT**

Yes, you can do a smoke test sometimes, but in most cases, **this is not gonna work**. In the **SaaS** industry, where the **barriers of usage** for a user is very low, if you don't give the product to the hands of the customer **ASAP**, be sure that he will **switch** **instantly** to a competitor that actually offers the product already working.

It doesn't have to be perfect. It's better to adopt a ""**build fast, improve faster**"" approach, in order to market as soon as possible your product, give it to the hands of customers and r**eceive feedbacks**.

**2.** **THERE ARE 2 STAGE YOU NEED TO OVERCOME (and probably hate): BPMF** *(before product market fit)* and **APMF** *(after product market fit)*

It is **damn difficult** to reach the PMF stage, but you'll know for sure once you've reached it. When? When you can't keep up with the **customer support requests!**

If you are making less than **$500k/yea**r, and you still don't have an ICP, you **HAVE NOT** reached the PMF, so you are in the BPMF. In this stage, don't even think to scale.

Focus only on providing the most valuable product experience to the user, until you define 1-2 recurring buyer personas that account for the 80% of your total revenue.

The last element to know you have reached the PMF is a sound net promoter score. How? If at least 50% of your users answer ""they will be **VERY** disappointed if they could use no more your product/service"".

3. **DON'T BUILD SOMETHING YOU THINK USERS WANT, BUILD WHAT USERS ACTUALLY WANT**

**Ideas nowadays are useless.** Coming up with a startup/product idea must be **market-centric** (market need -&gt; product idea) , coming up with product feature must be **user-centric** (user usage -&gt; new features for the product -&gt; feature release).

Look how UI/UX impact user's usage and metrics (churn, activation,ecc.) and decide what to do next.

**Don't wonder, just analyze data**. Data is literally telling you exactly what to build, and how to do it.

Eager to know your experience with those 3 points, let's chat in the comment section :)",4,startups,1730908191.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gl1l01/3_things_i_learned_about_b2b_saas_that_you_should/,experience,"['All great points.

We have been good friends for a while and always talked here and there about starting a company. I kind of stopped the ""talking"" and got to work and a week or two later told my friend that hey this is what I have been working on and we agreed to do it together.  I am CEO and he joined as CTO. 

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could! 

  
TLDR: 2 week hire wants to be CFO (they are good at what they do so far) what is the best way to judge if they are suitable and what would be a good compensation model for them given they are not a cofounder?

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There‚Äôs no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We‚Äôre not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here‚Äôs the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we‚Äôve put into the company. Right now, he‚Äôs unable to pay more money because he‚Äôs fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states¬†**""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""**¬†which doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. I‚Äôm not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I‚Äôm a software engineer‚ÄîI can code fast and efficiently‚Äîbut this feels like uncharted territory.

I‚Äôm currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I‚Äôm not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I‚Äôm skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes,¬†**stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He‚Äôs also offered $500‚Äì$1000 a month, but I‚Äôd honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here‚Äôs my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or perspectives from this community.

I‚Äôm in the process of validating a US travel-focused platform (non AI related), and I‚Äôd love to get your insights on estimating ad costs. The platform is a free website that combines elements of a blog, newsletter, and curated travel guides for things to do in specific locations. Right now, I‚Äôm focused on affiliate marketing to generate revenue, and my goal is to drive initial traffic to the site to test its viability.

I‚Äôve researched CPC estimates for running ads via GPT, Claude, and a web search, and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with for a starting point, but I'm not sure where I would land in these CPC's:

|**Platform**|**Low CPC**|**Average CPC**|**High CPC**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Facebook**|$0.30|$0.80|$2.00|Lower costs for broad targeting, higher for specific travel intent.|
|**Instagram**|$0.40|$1.20|$3.00|Higher engagement but generally more expensive than Facebook.|
|**YouTube**|$0.10|$0.30|$4.00|Video views can be cheap, but travel-related clicks can cost more.|
|**Pinterest**|$0.10|$0.70|$1.50|Great for travel inspiration with relatively low competition.|
|**Google Ads**|$0.50|$2.50|$5.00+|Travel is competitive, especially for popular destinations like Las Vegas.|
|**Twitter (X)**|$0.20|$0.80|$2.50|Less travel-focused but good for real-time promotions.|

Does this align with what others have experienced when running ads for travel-related content, Newsletters or affiliate-based platforms? Are there any platforms you‚Äôd suggest that might be under-utilized or offer lower CPCs for this niche?

Some context:

* We want to target induvial in or going to a specific undetermined US location.
* My budget is modest since I‚Äôm in the validation phase.

Also, if there are any tips for keeping costs low while driving targeted traffic, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37eea,1gnp0a0,Made 60k mrr for a business by just lead nurturing. Need suggestions and validation. ,"Apart from the story I need a suggestion and validation here. It's a bit long, skip to tl;dr if you 
couldn't handle length.

A few days ago, I saw a person on Reddit sharing his struggles that,  Even after generating a lot of leads from ads of Meta and Google (even with lowest cpc cpa cpl), he was not able to  convert them into sales. 

Out of curiosity I dm'ed him with all fancy services that I offer and expressed that as a agency I would work with him for monthly recurring fee. He suggested for one time consulting fee, I agreed. 

It  was literally a eye opener for me. This guy is in coaching business offering courses for people. His niche was too vague. Courses were on mindset coaching, confidence and public speaking coaching, right attitude coaching,  manifestation coaching and all crap shits related to this. At first I thought he was not getting sales because who will pay for all this craps. I openly discussed with him that he has to change what he offers because, if I saw this ad I wouldn't buy this for sure. He then showed me how much money people offering similar service are making . I was literally taken back. He was part of a influencer group (the main guy who encourages these guys to start coaching business, looks like some mlm shit) where people post their succes stories. Literally lot of guys were making above 150k and 200k per month. Even with very basic landing page and average offer They are still winning. 

Here's where it gets interesting. I tried to clone everything that the top people in this industry are doing in marketing from end to end.( like the same landing page, bonus offers around 50k, exclusive community, free 1 on 1 calls for twice a month).Nothing worked for a month and later surprisingly  even the sales started dropping a bit more. 

I got really confused here. So to do a discovery I went and purchased the competitor course and Man I was literally taken back. Like he has automated everything from end to end. You click the ad, see vsl, you have to fill a form and join a free Skool community where he gives away free stuffs and post success stories of people who took the course. Now every part of this journey you will get a follow up mail and follow up sms. Like after filling the form. after that now if you join and don't purchase the course you will be pampered with email and sms filled with success stories. For sure anybody will be tempted to buy the course.

Here is the key take away. He was able to make more sales because he was very successful in nurturing the leads with follow ups after follow ups. Even after you purchased his course he is making passive income from 1 on calls and bonus live webinars. So follow ups will be for 1 on 1 calls and webinars after the course is over. 

Core point is our guy even after spending 2 to 3k per month on ads was not able to bring huge sales like competitors because he failed the nuture them. Even after making the same offers and the same patterns of marketing as competitors, the sales declined because people thought this is some spam that everyone is doing because the template of the ads was very professional and similar. suprising one is people fall for basic templates thinking it's a underrated one. 

so what we did here is we integrated a few softwares into one and set up all same webinars, automated email and sms follow ups, ad managers for stats, launched him a free LMS platform where without any additional fees so he can uploaded unlimited courses, skool like community and add product's like Shopify ( he was selling few merchandise with his brand name on) where he can add unlimited products with connection to all payment gateway, integrated with crm with unlimited contacts, workflow and lead nurturing with calender syncing for 1 on 1 calls.

But these are a bit old school, what we did was even better. integrated a conversational ai with all of his sales platforms and gave a nocode automation builder with ai for the workflow. we also set him up with a ai voice agent that's automatically calls and markets for his course and also replies for queries when called.  we also set up him a dedicated afflitate manager portal with automated commissions. 

Though he didn't cross 100k Mark, He did a great number after this. He was struggling with 6k sales, now he has reached somewhere mid of 45k to 50k mrr. Max he hit was 61.8k. I see this a big difference.So one small thing, nurturing the lead can bring you immense sales. 

To set up all of this it costs around 1.2k monthly for me with all the bills. ( I know there are few free for Individual user platforms out there, but It gets very costly when you switch to their premium plans. with heavy volumes you would require more than premium they offer.) I offered him like 3k per month to work as a agency for him who takes care of all these stuffs. He declined and offered for one time set up fee stating that he will pay 1.2k directly. The one time fee was also a bit low, though I agreed since this was a learning for me. 

what happened next after that is, he referred me to a few other people in the same niche. But the problem is they are not interested in spending 1 to 2 k in bills for software. They requested that if, will I be able to provide the saas alone for less than 500 dollars with one time set up fee. I haven't responded yet since I have to take an enterprise plan for all the software used and pay full advance price for billings. Then to break even that I have to make minimum 50 or odd users for that. let's grantly say 100 users with all other future costs. 

So here's what I'm planning to do. I'm planning to offer this as saas for let's say 239 dollars per month. with may or may not one time set up fee. ( I checked the entire internet, there is no single person offering at this price point for unlimited. Also one can easily start their marketing agency with this.) 

The suggestion and validation that I need here is 
1.are you going through the same struggles or faced these struggles?
2. would you be interested to buy at 239 dollars per month?
3. let's say you're from a different niche, Did the features I told were okay for you or you need something specific for your industry that you will be interested in buying? 

please answer in comments and if you will purchase for this price let me know in comments/dms. I will take that into account and if the response rate is above 100 queries, then will integrate this and sell for that price. 

(ps: If you see this post on similar subs, please bear cause I'm trying to get suggestions from different POV)

tl;dr - 
* lead nurturing can massively boost sales
*I made a software integration for a client for a 1.2k per month billing and here I want to know if more than 100 people are interested so that I will make this into my own saas and sell it for like a cheap price of 239 dollars per month

I don't want anything paid, just recs for folder structure, like how far do you allow subjects to go. (Engineering -&gt; Project name -&gt; Electrical -&gt; Components -&gt; etc.).

If each entry needs a complex timestamp and context object upon creation to meet the needs of step #1, it\'s probably too difficult.  Even if you have a little helper script, then do you want to have to circulate that to your assistants and peers so they can follow the system when you\'re away or not able to enforce it?  Too much.

All methods need to support some easy-to-use concept of cross-referencing so you can smooth over the limitations in whatever approach emerges.\n\nIt wouldn\'t hurt to play with some free tools (maybe starting with some short-term projects where they will get some real use but won\'t eff up important ""static"" tasks like regulatory filings) if only to see how they are handling important concepts like linking/referencing, search, sharing, backup/snapshots/exports, etc.', 'I‚Äôve been building a self-organizing file system for B2B, and through my user research I‚Äôve found basically every individual has their own idea of the best way to organize everything. \n\nThere‚Äôs no one right answer here, and with that there‚Äôs very little consistency from org to org.

As startup and one of the challenging things to manage was internal operations especially given that it was a fintech driven business serving merchants. As is usual with many startups there were a number of manual operational workflows, but where it becomes a bit challenging is when some of these manual workflows although not part of your IP start to slow you down, but given your resources you unfortunately cannot dedicate resources for said development, so you piece workarounds. Internal drag-and-drop tools can sometimes help but for more complex workflows can be hard to work with.

These challenges sometimes tend to get better as you grow but typically at the expense of an increased head count and bloated operations costs. Which can hinder growth, I have seen this manual workflows persists at both and even some large companies so no one is immune. These manual workflows can range anywhere from internal customer onboarding, data entry, data transformation tasks to mundane sales and marketing ops tasks and sometimes when not done optimally can be costly, I remember how painful it was when we lost a few merchants due to some of the challenges above.

So I would love to open a discussion regarding how do you currently manage internal ops workflows especially with the advent of AI,

\- what is the hardest thing about executing or maintaining these workflows ?

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f29,1glvdnb,"Startup chaos, paranoid manager","I work as a writer for an early stage startup that is trying to scale very heavily right now. So everything feels like a sprint. There are just too many issues with this startup, from the lack of communication between teams, toxic management, and the lack of accountability and proper project management. And I know these are all common startup issues. But my biggest issue by far is my manager. She is so young and inexperienced and she seems like the type of person who is just paranoid about deadlines and about not seeming competent enough and not impressing the higher-ups enough. The other day she asked me to look into sth that the CEO (her direct manager) asked us to look into and we found out that it was usually led by another team. So when I wanted to update the CEO on that and let him know that the other team is usually in charge because they have those connections, my manager was like ""update him in a way that doesn't seem like you just didn't want to do it"" which I thought was so disrespectful and unprofessional. 

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.. she micromanages everything. Like when I give her my estimate for when things can get done, she negotiates with me to try to pressure me to get things done earlier. I usually push back but why do I have to keep pushing back so she can back off and start respecting my decisions and estimates? And she leaves passive aggressive comments on my drafts and is so unprofessional with her communication style sometimes. And she is always worried about being criticized by execs for stuff that's literally outside her control like unreasonable deadlines and short-notice tasks. And the other day she said that to me too. She was like ""we don't want our team to be criticized for not pursuing sth hard enough even though it's blocked by sb external!!!""

My question is: do you think she is just naturally paranoid or is the company culture so toxic that execs just have a tendency to blame and pin sth on you, even though sometimes it's just not feasible or completely blocked by sb internal or external? Has anybody ever dealt with this type of management at a startup?

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37d00,1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

What do you think of those strategies?

I have taken a couple of stabs at startups and one made it to an LLC. The startup that made it to the LLC died during COVID, and never made it to any sort of monetary stage that justified a bank account. I received a nastygram in my email because I forgot to dissolve the LLC and it looks like I owe some on the annual fees to keep it active. 

I am starting an athletic clothing line, and want to create an LLC for this business. Looking for advice if I can/should just pay up on the old LLC and then DBA as the new company, or just dissolve the prior LLC and start fresh. 

Sorry if this is wordy, but I would appreciate any advice you may be willing to share.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d63,1h0jfmd,Slicing Pie is the answer,"At least once a week there's a question here asking about equity split between founders.  The only fair answer is Slicing Pie (google it because the first time I posted this, mods took it down)

I say this as someone who:

1. Had to buy out my co-founder at my first startup and
2. Who is now using Slicing Pie

I won't dive into the details of Slicing Pie (unless anyone has any questions) but I'll tell you why its the only way I'll do things.

I started my first startup with a guy who was an excellent developer. We're both really good techies but he had much more skill than I did and helped bring a lot of ideas to the product.  However, he ended up losing interest after we launched the product because he somehow believed that the money would just start flowing on its own.   When that didn't happen he became less and less involved until he ultimately abandoned the company altogether.

The story has a happy ending, because I bought him out and moved on, but it was a super huge pain in the ass and overly contentious in ways it didn't need to be.  It could have gone much worse, however, because ownership was set at 60/40 and he could have held on until the end and caused all sorts of headache.

This is where the right application of Slicing Pie would have allowed for everything to go much more smoothly.

First, the entire premise behind Slicing Pie is that your ownership is based on what you contribute.  Depending on how you set it up, contributions can be in the form of time, expenses, or some other value provided.  To keep it simple: if you work 1000 hours and your co-founder works 500 hours, then you have 2x the equity.

In some situations, someone might say ""but my hour is worth more"".  Sure, if your anticipated salary is more expensive, then you can set it up so your hours count for more money.

Others might say ""well, my \*value\* provided to the company is more"" (for instance, sales vs. code).  That's fine, too. For us, we have things set up so there's a deferred commission scheme. With a commission of 5%, the person who gets the sale can put all of that cash back into the company, but consider that amount to be part of the overall fund.

The best part of Slicing Pie is that if you don't contribute, you don't get squat and if you do contribute, you get the value you give.

The 2nd best part is if someone decides they're not interested anymore, or they're unable to keep the prior pace, or something else happens, their stake in the company is continually diminished.

On this latter point, i don't recommend just saying you're using Slicing Pie. You need to form your initial agreements around it.  There's a bunch of resources and sample agreements on the Slicing Pie website.   What we did at my latest company is base the entire Operating Agreement around one of the agreements on that page.  We then went over it with our lawyer to customize things for us and to make sure everything was in compliance with the state we're formed in.

Two of the more important parts in our Operating Agreement are that we have the ability to remove someone who has abandoned the company and we can drag them along on investment, or M&amp;A.  In the case of abandonment, they can then also be bought out for FMV of their contribution. In the case of a drag along, that's just a standard drag along.

All in all I can't think of a more fair way of determining equity and avoiding conflict. And I never would have heard about it had it not been for people mentioning it here on r/startups",9,startups,1732646946.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h0jfmd/slicing_pie_is_the_answer/,experience,"['I‚Äôm sorry, but MERITOCRACY is apparently a separate idea that you have to call it ‚Äúslicing pie‚Äù in business?

We took money from a lot of first funds, only to realize they arent planning on raising another one and can't actually support us or the company long-term. This messes up your entire cap table, because the spaces for a large cheque to come in are already taken by someone that can't support you long term. The valuations are already set by those funds as well, it puts the startup in a nasty position long-term. \n\nEarly funds also have less value to bring, they often give really naive advice because they haven't seen many different types of business models. Their network is early, they can't pull half as much help as a seasoned VC firm can, but they will expect the same equity/deals as a top-tier VC fund. And they certainly will not tell you any of this when they're in talks with you. \n\nEarly funds are extremely susceptible to market conditions, because they have to raise another fund at some point in the near future. They will pressure their founders with bad advice that's trending so they prop their startups up to their LP's, then punish founders when it doesnt work out the way they expected. \n\nI wished I knew that many VC's literally have no idea what they are talking about.

If they don't they are mainly just giving trendy advice. Like I was honestly amazed when I was doing the rounds with my AI startup in 2016 and the majority of investors were trying to encourage me to add block chain to my AI company for seemingly no valid reason beyond box ticking.\n\nWhat makes startups hard is capturing the right features into a product in a simple enough way that people can just pick it up and run with it. How you connect your sales message to your customers and how you reach out to them so they even realise it's an option and give it a go.

Sounds great in theory. But in reality, I\'ve found that moving too fast can actually slow you down. Here\'s why: users often need time to properly test and integrate a feature into their workflow before they can give meaningful feedback. If you\'re changing things every week, you\'re not really giving them that chance.  \n  \nFor example, we once rapidly pushed out 3 different versions of our main dashboard in 2 months, thinking we were being ""agile."" But our users were just confused and frustrated. When we finally slowed down and let a single version breathe for 2-3 months, we got much more valuable feedback and actually made better decisions.  \n  \nThe real lesson?

It\'s technically not feasible because it\'s so flaky. For example, book me an Uber from X to Y. Their idea was to use some headless browser to carry out the clicks and form completions. Anyone in QA or worked with QA teams will know this is incredibly hard to maintain, especially if you don\'t own that web site / service.\n\nI think what we\'ll start to see is Uber creating their own agents and then being able to plug that into an LLM infrastructure like ChatGPT.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37f1b,1gm8984,"Being asked to be a figurehead CEO, yay or run?","I'm a technical co-founder of an early stage startup. Between me and my co-founder, it was decided I would lead as the CEO/CTO and they will lead customer acquisition. I handle all investor relations as CEO.

Recently as we're starting to take off, my co-founder made it clear to me that it was intended that my CEO title was actually a figurehead, and I would only front the company on the outside as far as clients and investors are concerned.

As with most startups, we didn't pay much attention to organisation structure and were pretty much a flat structure. Co-founder proposed a new structure that carved a large party of the company to report under him. It's an entirely separate line of reporting that reports to him at the top and he reports to nobody, not even me as the CEO. To illustrate, I basically only have control over software development, as CEO.

Naturally I am wondering how a company with 2 sets of hierarchies works and challenged the concept. I'm also concerned behind my liabilities in bearing the CEO title, being the public front, whole not having access to major company information centers such as finance. That's when the possibility of creating a Co-CEO came up.

I'm trying hard to figure out how I can continue to make this work. Obviously there's concerns with meeting fiduciary, regulatory and ethical concerns here while misrepresenting centers of control. I just don't see how a startup needs such complicated reporting lines to begin with. It's unnecessary bloat without evening mentioning that no startups needs a Co-CEO in my opinion.

I don't mind stepping down and ceding CEO to him so I focus on being a CTO, however it appears that it's very much intended for me to STAY in this role as a figurehead.

In general, co-founder already makes unilateral decisions in a lot of matters of the company, from commercial to our books and investor relations. That's caused a bit of a friction as it usually runs counter to my direction, and sometimes I only find out about things after they've happened. Hence I'm wondering if it might be easier to stop looking over my shoulder and just step down. Though I've read that founder infighting and power struggles at an early stage are a strong indicator of potential failure down the road.

Would appreciate opinions on:

1. Outlook of the company given such weird dynamics now
2. Being a 'puppet' CEO
3. Co-CEOs in a startup
4.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d5d,1h0o1es,How I went from thinking I can never make online money to making my first ever 4 figures online.,"I wanted to share my journey, especially with those of you working on your side projects and feeling stuck.

Before I started my¬†web design agency¬†as a side project, I failed at seven different business ideas.

Each failure was tough, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt think about giving up. But those failures turned out to be the best foundation for what I‚Äôm doing now. Here‚Äôs why:

**1. Every Failure Taught Me Something Valuable**  
Each of those seven businesses forced me to learn a new skill:

* A failed dropshipping store taught me the basics of copywriting.
* A print-on-demand project helped me understand customer research.
* Freelance gigs that flopped showed me how to manage budgets better.

When I launched my web design agency, all those skills came together and gave me a head start.

**2. I Learned to Focus on the Long Game**  
At first, I was chasing quick wins, jumping from idea to idea because I thought the next one would be ‚Äúit.‚Äù Failing so many times forced me to slow down and focus on building something sustainable, even if it took longer.

**3. I Became Resilient**  
Let‚Äôs be real, rejection sucks. And after being ghosted by leads, hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù over and over, and seeing months of work fail, it‚Äôs easy to want to quit. But failing taught me that rejection isn‚Äôt the end, it‚Äôs feedback to improve.

**4. I Realized It‚Äôs Okay to Fail Forward**  
One of my biggest failures was getting scammed out of $2.5k in a remote opportunity. That loss left me terrified of trying anything online again. But I eventually realized that failure wasn‚Äôt a dead end‚Äîit was a lesson to trust myself and do my due diligence better.

**5. I Finally Hit My Breakthrough**  
Fast forward to my current side hustle: a web design agency.

For the first 8 months, I struggled to get clients. I worked on everything:

* Creating an irresistible offer
* Improving my outreach process
* Practicing my design skills

Nothing clicked. Until one day, in the 9th month, it all came together.

I closed 3 deals in 6 days, making my first 4 figures online. That wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the skills and resilience I built from those earlier failures.

If you‚Äôre stuck on your side project or feeling like it‚Äôs not going anywhere, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

* Every failure is feedback. use it.
* Build skills that transfer, even if this project doesn‚Äôt work out.
* Focus on why you‚Äôre building your project, not just the outcome.

Most importantly: Don‚Äôt quit. You‚Äôre probably closer to your breakthrough than you realize.

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all feedback positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting**¬†after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.**¬†Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

Firstly, I will share details about me. I am a bootstrap founder, meaning that I don't spend money on marketing or sales. Because I don't have money for that right now, and trying to use all ways to maximize my efforts.

People really want simple things that solve their problems. Because of that you don't need to sell them something, but what they really need is to see that your solution can help them. You can do it in different ways, beginning with targeting ads or setting up Google Ads. But it will be another story.

Let's start.

1) Understand where hanging out your ideal customer is. For my cases it is X, Reddit, and LinkedIn. You need to start posting content related to your niche and product. In the beginning, focus on niche as long as you can. Because all you need is to understand their problems and improve on each request.

2) Give your perfect customer a free trial or free usage. Don't ask anything upfront. Just give them and be around. If they have any questions or ideas, write them down immediately. Try to document everything they say. You can analyze it later. After giving free usage or a free trial. Write them a personalized email or message, could they give feedback or review (ONLY AFTER USING YOUR APP, AND AUTHORIZATION). If they don't want to give, no problem, don't do anything, don't be rude, don't take away his/her usage. LET IT BE. A lot of people, especially in the beginning who are ready to give their time to your product, will be your best friends. All you really need to do is ask. 80% of them will give you what you want.

3) After understanding your ideal customer and getting at least 50-100 ideas/reviews/feedback from free users, you need to find general and common problems. Take them and work, work, work on it. After getting it done. Go to the next step.

4) You are ready to launch. Submit to directories as your product category. Write SEO articles from day one based on your website content (do it each day). If there is a need for free tools on the same topic as you do, you need to build them under different pages. For example, if you do wealth planning, it is good to have a wealth calculator. Don't build it blindly. Go to Google Keywords and analyze trends and keywords that people are searching for. It is your juicy traffic.

5) If you are doing B2B business, you need to generate a lot of cold emails. If you are doing B2C, you need to generate a lot of short videos on Youtube, TikTok, and Instagram, and ideally to generate content on platforms like Reddit and X.",0,startups,1731496675.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gqami4/how_to_boost_visitors_to_websites/,experience,"['If you‚Äôre neither and expert nor got asked, then why spam Reddit about it?']"

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I‚Äôve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it‚Äôs so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I‚Äôve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I‚Äôve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don‚Äôt deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I‚Äôm basically running it for free.

Would be curious about if anyone would like to give it a try. I‚Äôm building it as an open source tool, but I don‚Äôt have any docs yet. So leave a comment for me to know there would be interest and I‚Äôll write docs so you can run it yourself.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37d03,1h4cuu8,Asking about an idea.,"I have seen multiple coupon website over the years, but the whole thing is kinda broken. Free coupons don't work. But these days, apps give us coupons on transactions or purchases, and it often turns out we don't need them most of the time.

I tried out some of these coupons, and they don't need any user account association.

Instead of wasting these coupons, would it be viable to create a platform, where people can upload their coupons and exchange them for a different one from another user! Kindof like a bidding platform.

Incase they do not like any coupons to exchange for, maybe they can set a nominal price on the coupons, so someone else can pay to buy.

I‚Äôm working on creating an MVP for an online will and trust generator. The idea is that users can complete a form to create a legally valid will, sign it electronically, and store it securely. I‚Äôm not a developer myself, so I'm trying to make this happen with as few technical barriers as possible.

Right now, I‚Äôm considering using¬†**WeWeb**¬†for the front end and¬†**Supabase**¬†for the backend (handling user data, authentication, etc.). I like the idea of WeWeb because it seems user-friendly and flexible, and Supabase seems to offer the data security I need.

Does this sound like a good approach for an MVP? Are there any potential issues I should watch out for, or maybe better alternatives that could simplify things? Any tips on handling things like conditional logic in the form or integrating with e-signature tools would be super helpful too.

This is a great first step since the majority of startups typically fall in that moment where they fall in love with their idea and stick to it blindly. This kind of introspection is what separates mediocre startups from successful ones.\n\nSince I've been building products and validating ideas with startups and entrepreneurs for almost a decade, here are a few strategies that helped me assess the potential of an idea and carve out a strong position in the market:\n\n1. **Identify a niche‚Äôs unique needs or problems**: Even in competitive spaces like sales intelligence, there‚Äôs room to thrive if you can solve a specific problem for a particular audience. Go from the top niche and then define the sub-niche. Learn their pain points and needs, and solve them well. For example, smaller companies may prioritize affordability, simplicity, or tailored data insights that the big players aren‚Äôt offering.\n2. **Embrace differentiation**: Being different doesn‚Äôt always mean reinventing the wheel. It could be your approach to UX, pricing models, integrations, or customer success. Ask: *What will make someone choose my product over a competitor's?* You can go with two strategies blue ocean or red ocean.\n3. **Think beyond product features**: Peter Thiel‚Äôs point about monopolies is valid, but it‚Äôs never about tech. You can build a monopoly through ecosystems or platforms of different services that are in one place, brand loyalty \\*think Apple, etc.\n4. **Run small validation experiments**: Without diving too deep into the process that I follow, what I always suggest is to test your idea with small-scale experiments. You can create a landing page, do some advertising, track leads, and always check if people are willing to pay for your product. Focus groups or some in-person workshops can work. Check innovation games, they have lots of great in-person exercises to get real validation and feedback.\n5. **Focus on execution**: Many ideas have been executed before, but execution is where companies win or lose. Maybe your services will set your product apart because these big players have a bad support system (this is just an example). In the end, it's all about the value that you are delivering to the customers which is the most important thing.\n6. **Shift from competitor obsession to customer obsession**: Of course,e it is important to understand your competitors and create a strategy how to position your product out there, but your customers are the key. Why are they choosing them? What are they writing that is missing there and do they need it? Can you solve the problem they keep writing about? All these things will help you better position your product on the market.\n\nIf you‚Äôre still circling these ideas and want more specific frameworks to evaluate or position your startup, feel free to DM me.

If you want to start a 'zero to one' company, just be ready for the fact that you will almost certainty fail, no matter how good you are or how much money you have.

I don‚Äôt know what your business is, but it likely doesn‚Äôt compete in the same arena.\n\nAlso, take Thiel‚Äôs opinions on competition and Monopoly there with a grain of salt. They are ‚Äúperfect‚Äù examples without elaborate on other factors.\n\nFor instance, a hyper-competitive market would not have all of its profits competed away if different businesses in that market are able to execute with different levels of competence. Businesses which are able to do a better job of providing a product or service will be able to charge a premium. Different businesses in the same market are unique given the type of customer they serve. This is why luxury brands exist in the clothing, industry, which is an industry that is already hyper competitive and commoditized.\n\nalternatively there are asymmetries in the customer base. Two customers can live 10 miles away from a shop, but only one of them is willing to drive that distance and would rather shop online, creating more demand for someone who has an online presence and delivery.\n\nThe Takeaway is right now you need to determine if you have customer demand. If you do have customer demand, you need to understand what your customers are able and willing to pay for your product or service to determine if you have enough margin to sustain a healthy business.', 'Peter Thiel is evil, so you can disregard him for that. With Ai it‚Äôs going to be VERY easy to replicate any SAAS unless it‚Äôs got something unique under the hood (and even then, that‚Äôs up for debate).. IMHO big saas is dead.

Not every successful business has to aim for monopoly-like dominance to thrive. If you're carving out a niche in sales intelligence/SaaS for smaller companies, you're already differentiating yourself.\n\nInstead of being discouraged, focus on building something unique that truly solves a problem for your target audience. Execution, customer insights, and continuous iteration often matter more than the idea itself. Plenty of successful companies weren't 'zero to one' breakthroughs‚Äîthey simply out-executed their competitors or addressed underserved markets.\n\nAsk yourself: How can you build a product so good that your customers don't want to leave? What unique value do you provide that others can't easily replicate?

The problem is not if anyone can copy you (though he has said to dominant you can use patent) ofcourse anything can be copied but its about how you absolutely dominate the market. By monopoly and dominance its not about searching the industry which does not have any competitor, but to be so best that when people think of searching they should think about your company. For example google\'s search competitors are [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai), bing, etc but still Google dominates the search market. Same thing is if i have to book apartment i think about Airbnb. I dont even know if there is a competitor of Airbnb for BnB.

Teams could onboard themselves to your product just by having their Software team read your Documentation and entering a credit card.\n\nA big emphasis in Thiel's book is about just how often companies can achieve monopoly over their competitors while offering the exact same product by simply innovating on the business process, or the sales vector, or addressing a new target audience. \n\nBasically, you want to drill down on which beachhead market (niche) you want to start out with, and you also want to focus on ways to innovate on the business process.

I've worked on this product (exercising product) for around 2.5 yrs now. I took it really slow, and spent around +$15k in the development, all done by myself (and I have no prior experience developing an electronic product). the product consists of a PCBA + Enclosure + Rubber parts + Fiberglass parts. I worked directly with manufacturers in China. and after so many iterations, we were able to make the final samples.

a Quick breakdown:

**PCBA + Firmware**¬†\- I hired a freelancer to make it, then manufactured it with both JLCPCB + a CM that i found in Alibaba.

**Enclosure**¬†\- I hired a freelancer to design it - then 3d printed it.

**Rubber parts**¬†\- I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - it took several molds and attempts till we got it right.

**Fiberglass parts**¬†\- I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - and we got it right pretty quick.

I assembled the product many times that i can do it blindfolded now. I tested every aspect physically, improved the design, and got rid of things that are not necessary.

I have shown the product to people around me for testing and feedback. They liked it and the feedback was really positive. The product is really good, and exceeded all expectations (there is nothing like it in the market).

I kept the product in secret mode the majority of the time, the only person who knew 90% of the functionality was the freelancer who made the Firmware/Software for me, and he is a person that i personally trust.

I'm currently preparing a provisional patent, to start sharing the full idea with the manufacturer that will handle the manufacturing + assembly.

The product is not complicated and is very easy to understand.. IP thieves will have to figure how we did the silicon + fiberglass + firmware, in order to bring something similar to the market. My main goal is to be the first to market and not worry about these.

Now, i have the product in my hands, and don't know what to do next. it might not be the perfect version, but i think its +90% of that. and honestly, i cannot improve it any further..

The CM i found in Alibaba said that they can help with PCBA + Enclosure + Final product Assembly (after receiving the parts) + Packaging + Certifications. But, i don't know if i can trust them (They are well-known and verified though).

I keep asking myself these questions:

\- Should i go with one of these CMs? show them the product and start managing the process myself between factories ? (i don't want to give them the full responsibility - For IP)

\- What certifications will we need (we used ESP32 Module)? and how are we going to obtain it? and how can it be verified? what if we make slight modifications later to the PCBA, will we have to re-obtain these again?

\- What if the product/Assembly isn't 100% perfect? Will that matter for the first Batches? For Example: There might be a better and more reliable way to assemble certain parts and we haven't discovered it yet (even if its currently working fine).

I would appreciate any help from people who had similar experiences.

I learned a few things about manufacturing hardware in China in the process. I\'m far from an expert though.\n\nA few things I learned:\n\n- Chinese companies can make excellent quality products and they can make terrible quality products.  It\'s highly variable depending on the company, factory, price, and terms.\n\n- When talking to Chinese manufacturers, you could say something and they will say ""yes"" and it means ""I heard you"" rather than ""I agree to that"".  That\'s a language barrier thing, but it trips up a lot of people when they find out something they thought was agreed upon wasn\'t done. \n\n- Chinese companies highly prize making do with what they have to make things work. That\'s often a good thing, but with electronics manufacturing it can sometimes mean that important components get substituted with lower quality components.\n\n- Disreputable companies will make shadow runs - you\'ll ask for 1000 products; they\'ll make 2000 and then sell the extra 1000 under your name through distributors.  They\'ll be identical products.  Rare but it happens.\n\n- You can get manufacturing done in the US, too.  Not at the same cost and not on the same scale but if you\'re a startup just launching a product, that might be a safer route if you\'re worried about IP.', 'Your progress is amazing‚Äîbuilding this from scratch is no small feat! For certifications, consult a lab to ensure compliance, especially with the ESP32 module. Splitting tasks among suppliers and using NDAs can help protect your IP. Early batch imperfections are common‚Äîjust focus on functionality and gather feedback to improve.', 'I\'ve worked pretty closely with Chinese manufacturers in hardware development, and I\'d start with trademarking my product in China right away to protect your IP. This can happen concurrently as you\'re trying to source manufacturers. \n\nAre you able to travel to China at all to meet with some of these CMs and visit their facilities? China is a very relationship-focused culture, and a lot of ""managing the process"" entails managing relationships and building trust with the suppliers. They would be much more willing to handle your requests, troubleshoot, etc. with the right *guanxi* (‚Äúconnection""), so if you do plan on sticking with a manufacturer long term then some face-time in the beginning is worth the investment imo. \n\nCertifications would depend on the product, but it would help to do some research and have a preliminary list prepared. A good supplier would have an idea of the needed certifications, but it would be good to double check each component with the markets you\'re targeting for sales.\n\nFor quality control, it would help to prepare a QC document with specific guidelines to follow for assembly and testing.

Send your product to an EMC lab for a pre-FCC test; it costs around  $500(depends on the lab) and can save money if design changes are needed.

But probably that will be all.\n\nAssembly and Quality\n\nIf budget allows, get feedback from quality or industrial engineers. Otherwise, perform a time study by having an unskilled person assemble the product using only instructions. Record times for each step and streamline processes (e.g., reducing screws) to optimize for mass production. For example a complex product like a smart phone takes less then 5 mins. Sounds unnecessary, but it can make your product quite competitive.\n\nRun basic quality tests relevant to your product, such as drop tests or waterproofing for specific IP ratings (e.g., IP55).\n\n\nYou can use trusted CMs but i would suggest to handle firmware flashing yourself. You can flash  100 units/hour with a programming jig.Cloning is less likely for niche products with low volumes, but nothing is secret in China.

We're an enterprise software startup (first time founders) operating in the scm space, and after months of restless work we finally got our first client and a lot of traction. We randomly met some BAs (= Angel Investor) after being invited to talk on some public panel.

The valuation we agreed upon is around $6 million, and they're collectively buying about 4%. This injection will (kinda) cover our most urgent operational costs for the next year combined with our revenue (hopefully). So there is still some significant financial risk after this investment and looking at the current global economy this fear recently grew in all of us.

Did we push our valuation too high, risking the possibility of a future down round if we need more capital?  
Should we take this momentum and double down to seek out more BAs and early-stage VCs at the same valuation to secure some extra funds?  
Can we push this with the LOI of the BAs or is it meaningless to other investors?

I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always). 

Our strongsuite vs competitors is SEO, which is where we're doing a lot better than some, but they seem to be getting more traffic, revenue (1 competitor hit $1m ARR in 6 months using YouTube &amp; Google ads only) which is pretty mind boggling to me. 

So we're planning to run YT, Google ads and an extensive competitor research stint, that'll help us replicate this. 

Any who was in a similar situation have any advice on this?

That additional $50 in their pocket is called consumer surplus. That\'s how you convert. You sell on the value you are giving someone and not the cost of something. \n\nA fundamental understanding of the subjective theory of value and consumer surplus is your route to not only selling but maximising the price with which you can charge for your service. \n\nGo back and assess your competition. Look at the top 3-5. What value are they selling, and at what price point. How are they speaking to their customers, how are they positioning themselves. When you look at their offerings and their price point how does it make you feel? Do you feel like they\'re generating great consumer surplus? Do you get that feeling of it being a good deal? \n\nIf you look at what they are offering, the price they are charging and then compare it with yourself, where does that put you? Does that provide any insight into why a customer is _not_ choosing your product? \n\nDon\'t compete on price, it\'s a race to the bottom and if they only thing you offer is that you\'re the cheapest then all someone has to do to displace you is to charge less. Focus on generating the greatest subjective value, and then aggressively position the consumer surplus. You don\'t want none, but too much is just money on the table. \n\nTl;Dr: When talking to customers talk in terms of how your service is helping them and not how you\'re accomplishing it, when considering what you\'re charging focus on maximising the value to the customer and charging at a level that makes them feel like they\'re getting more than they are paying.\n\nYou\'re probably charging too little and not selling the value instead of the technology.', '1.

Here it\'s all about creating good ads that have a good hook and covert. \n* We publish about 25 new ads a week at the minimum, as its a strategic volume game. Testing, testing, testing.

I‚Äôm a digital nomad currently based in the U.S., but I travel a lot and love the freedom this lifestyle brings. Right now, I‚Äôm in the process of building my own startup, and I‚Äôve been deeply inspired by Pieter Levels‚Äô journey.

For those who may not know, Pieter Levels is a well-known digital nomad who‚Äôs built multiple highly profitable businesses, including Nomad List, Remote OK, PhotoAi, and even a merchandise business. Beyond websites, he also generates income through YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and other streams. He‚Äôs an incredible example of how someone can bootstrap and scale multiple businesses while staying remote.

**Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm curious about:**

1. **Business Structure:**¬†Does anyone know how entrepreneurs like Pieter set up their business income streams? Are they typically routed through a single entity like an LLC, or are they managed as separate entities for each project? If everything is routed through the LLC, should the LLC elect s-corp status?
2. **Taxes for Nomads:**¬†As someone living the nomadic lifestyle, how do you manage taxes when you‚Äôre earning from multiple sources across different jurisdictions? Do you consolidate everything under one tax structure or file separately for each income stream? Especially since I live across many states in the US, does that mean i have to file taxes at all these states? Also my websites operate worldwide, so how would taxes in general work? I heard Wyoming is a good place to set up the LLC because of the flexibility and zero state taxes it provides.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to structure my own business as I grow and diversify, and I‚Äôd love to hear your insights. If you‚Äôre juggling multiple ventures or have advice on simplifying operations while staying nomadic, I‚Äôd be super grateful for your input!

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f6c,1gjs9f1,Getting market validation quicker through beta testing?,"I am aiming to launch a company that sells audio plugins people can use in creative projects. I work a fullstack engineering job during the day but have been building audio projects for some time now and have had a loose idea of this company for a while now.

The problem is that what I consider necessary to launch the MVP (not just a plugin but the company as whole) is still a considerable amount of work, while I would like to focus on getting market validation for the actual plugin ideas as quickly as possible. Here's what I would ideally ship as part of an MVP / company launch:

- At least one complete plugin ready to sell
- A website to purchase the plugin and access your account
- Plugin authorization system to avoid having ""unlocked"" deliverables in the open

Minus the plugin authorization system I have built all of those things before, however it will still take a lot of time to build all of that out so what I am considering instead is ""soft"" launching with:

- One free downloadable plugin
- One plugin ready for beta testing
- A website that is basically just a landing page with an email newsletter signup that will give early adopters access to beta versions for testing

The only thing I need to build here is the website which won't take very much time. This way I can get the plugin into customers' hands and see how it actually fares out in the open. Then when the product is ready and I've had more time to build out the website and infrastructure more, officially launch the company and with the first paid plugin.

There are a couple concerns I have with this approach, namely that I want to maintain engagement and excitement with early adopters from opening the beta to the official launch. I worry about development being somewhat inconsistent making early adopters lose interest. Additionally, it would be great to have a more dedicated channel to receiving feedback directly from early adopters. Basic email communication is one way; I could fire up a Discord server although that seems a bit overkill at this point? I do see that being useful in the future for people wanting to chat, ask for support, etc.

Is this a practical and sensible way of thinking regarding the steps to an official launch?

I've been wanting to learn to code for some time now but it never felt worth it since, again, bubble can get me 90% there. But now it looks like I can use AI to get 100% there

She took the lead of the call as she wanted to understand better some issues we had with the facility .She was not letting him finish and was jumping to the next question . I was silent as I joined the call late . But then when I was jumping she was not letting me even speak which was getting frustrating . Then I interjected a point made by the facility operator . She then commented that we should let him speak as he had done it before . The facility operator then explained his point and I realised I misunderstood what he said but there was no way she would know I was wrong . She the. What‚Äôs app me suggesting we should let him think he is right . I am planning to have a call with her to tell her that she is great but it felt a bit patronising .

I want to start a breakfast in SOMA where other AI startup founders get together and just share notes and try to figure out how to help each other.

My goal here is to have other startup founders help each other out. Suggestions for hiring. Discussions on our tech infra / backend. Funding discussions, etc. 

I sold my last company in 2021 - it was a search / big data company that did data mining at scale on the web.

Right now I'm working on a startup that can build custom UIs based on LLMs and existing backends.  

My plan is to finish the PoC and then start raising money in a few months.

I'd like to do this every 2-4 weeks. Just get together before work and do so in an environment where everyone can actually *talk*.  

I hate environments where there are 100 people and everyone needs to yell at one another.  

DM me if you'd like an invite!

Since the past 4 months I've working on an online shopping app for my country, as there is a huge gap in the apps space here. I know zero coding and had hired a developer for cheap to develop the app for me, now the app is almost complete but i'm unsure about what i'll do for the maintenance of the app since the guy I was working with says that he'll be too busy to give it any tike. 

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code) 

I can either find someone to do maintenance for the app so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what's the procedure for that, what to keep in mind when hiring or giving access to the app, guidelines etc as I have zero tech knowledge. 

Also, if I hire a developer for maintenance, are there any chances he can like steal the app from me? like remove my access or anything (I'm already sorry if any of this sounds super silly) 

Another option I have is learn the basics myself and try to fix minor bugs myself if I come across any. Could you tell me how long would it take not to learn complete IOS or android development, but just simple maintenance or fixing bugs?

We have about $15k in debt (which I know isn't a huge deal and pales in comparison to some startup costs) and while I'd assume to just split the debt four ways (we're all on the CC which is currently carrying the debt), I'm curious to know if there are any other options? We understood the risks upfront and again will take care of the debt collectively over time (we all otherwise have FT jobs). 

I don't have a business background in the least so I apologize if my questions are terribly naive...

* Is there some random website that connects small startups with potential buyers? Specifically, it's more of an idea/concept that could be something with the right backing/experience behind it. We have a website and a couple trademarks, but don't have enough sales to provide balance sheets or assets, etc. Something where someone checks out the logistics and potentially offers an amount to take over? Like a small business ebay? haha
* Other than working with AmEx on a potential consolidation/shut-down payment plan, are there other options so that we can get off a CC? I've gone through SBA for a lower rate, but supposed ""matches"" don't seem to respond to my applications. I also sometimes get the ""we're not a good fit"" response with some loan sites, probably because the debt amount is lower than ideal for them. 

Ultimately, the answer very well may be to simply dissolve and split the debt, but wanted to throw it out there.

So far, we slightly exceeded our goal of doubling growth in 2024, and we seem to be quickly growing every quarter.

We have about a year of runway.

I‚Äôm hoping for the best, but I also want to prepare for the worst.

I have a couple questions about how shutting the company down works:

- Do they lay off everyone at once, or lay people off one by one? 

- If the latter is true, when will they start laying people off, and at what rate? Does this change if we get partial funding?

- It‚Äôs a SAAS company with small UX, marketing, sales, and CS teams and a relatively large eng team. I‚Äôm the only person on UX. Assuming everyone is meeting expectations, when would I expect to get laid off?

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c9a,1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I‚Äôd love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team‚Äôs mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team‚Äôs energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project‚Äôs progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can‚Äôt do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it‚Äôs important to recognize that. Admitting that you can‚Äôt do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it‚Äôs more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

Over the past three years, I‚Äôve balanced working in the entertainment industry with funding development out-of-pocket to bring this idea to life. So far, I have:

‚Ä¢ A almost finished MVP that‚Äôs being refined based on extensive market research

‚Ä¢ A clear monetization plan, including detailed cost estimations

‚Ä¢ A roadmap for the next steps post-launch, including scaling and growth

I don‚Äôt have a scripted pitch just yet, but I can clearly explain the app‚Äôs value, how it will make money, and the strategic vision behind it. I truly believe in the potential of this app, but without a marketing budget and time constraints from my job, I‚Äôm finding it challenging to prepare for launch and generate interest outside of my personal network.

Now, I‚Äôve reached a point where I‚Äôd like to bring in external funding. I‚Äôm hoping for a better equity deal than I would have gotten at an earlier stage, and I‚Äôd love to connect with investors who understand the potential of early-stage startups and are comfortable with apps that haven‚Äôt yet launched publicly.

So here are my main questions:

1.	Where can I find investors suitable for pre-launch, pre-seed stage investments?

2.	How do other founders who are also working full-time and putting everything into their startup cope with burnout and maintain their energy and motivation?

3.	Are there any startup or founder groups that you would recommend joining for a founder in the pre-seed phase? And are these communities valuable if you‚Äôre limited on time?

Platforms like AngelList, SeedInvest, and Crunchbase can help you identify potential investors who are interested in social media apps. Networking at local startup events, meetups, or industry conferences can also lead to valuable connections. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of online communities‚Äîsubreddits like r/startups or specific LinkedIn groups can provide leads and introductions.\n2. **Coping with Burnout**: Balancing a full-time job with a startup can definitely lead to burnout. I‚Äôve found that setting clear boundaries for your work hours can help. Try to allocate specific times for your startup work and stick to them, even if it means saying no to other commitments. Also, prioritize self-care: exercise, downtime, and hobbies outside of work can recharge your batteries. Consider practicing mindfulness or meditation to help manage stress and maintain focus.\n3. **Joining Founder Communities**: There are some great communities out there for startup founders, like Y Combinator‚Äôs Startup School, Indie Hackers, and various Slack groups. These platforms offer support, resources, and networking opportunities that can be valuable, even if your time is limited.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37d95,1gyulyq,Raising Funds ,"Hi All,

As someone who's long had entrepreneurial ambitions, I've finally settled on a project after years of consideration. I have detailed a business plan, along with other documents to lay out my startup. I was hoping to get some advice on funding options so that I am able to make this work. The main difficulty I have is that my idea is largely service-sector based, and without funds, I am not able to start up / demonstrate application. For reference, my target is roughly ¬£50-70k (depending on the scale of launch).

My current thoughts are:

Personal savings: Although I don't currently have the financial capacity for an investment of this amount, I could reach this goal within 2 or so years. However, that would be a significant delay, which is rather demotivating.

Angel investor: At the minute, my project is a mere idea. Without the funds, I am not able to demonstrate actionable application, which would make this very difficult.

Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding has provided many businesses with amazing opportunities. However, similar to angel investors, it's very difficult to galvanize the support of people without having something immediate to offer.

I would appreciate any advice on this‚Äîare there perhaps other options I've not considered? Are there ways to overcome the difficulties in my current methods?

At the moment, crowdfunding stands out to me as the most viable option. My project addresses various social objectives, which I feel could gain support from people. How am I able to promote my idea (besides platforms like Kickstarter)?

If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don‚Äôt meet those criteria, you‚Äôll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven‚Äôt already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free‚ÄîStripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

The current CEO started this company back in June without building anything till January. Then the previous cofounder left because they were not able to raise or build the product. 

Then in March I joined as the CTO with equal equity as the current CEO, and built the compete platform. 

The problem I am having is except for the vision, the CEO does not do anything. He does not want to write code or cannot do it. Is not creating any sales pipeline or marketing campaigns, just waiting for us to finish the product before he does any of those things. He is hoping that we sign up the enterprise customer and then we will do all of those things. 

We are a bootstrapped business where he is funding the infrastructure costs, but to me that feels like a failure on our end that we are not able to get any investment so that we can cover our expenses. 

And with all of this, he just wants to maintain authority over the business, he wants to take all important meetings alone, all public facing discussions he wants to do, without taking any action that can help the business.

That can be SaaS or other agencies.

","Human beings are imposters by definition‚Äîor at least we often feel that way.

We're riddled with self-doubt about our intellect, skills, and accomplishments. No matter where you are on your journey.

Impostor syndrome will strike, causing you to question your worth and abilities.

When that happens, clich√©s like¬†**‚ÄúFake it till you make it‚Äù**¬†or¬†**‚ÄúBelieve it till you achieve it‚Äù**¬†are often used as remedies. But let‚Äôs face it‚Äîthese are band-aids on a gunshot wound.

As a person finding their way, I‚Äôve faced the scourge of impostor syndrome time and again. It followed me like a shadow until I stopped managing symptoms. And started curing the disease.

The root cause of impostor syndrome is¬†**‚ÄúBelieving‚Äù**¬†you are something instead of¬†**‚ÄúKnowing‚Äù.**

*Let me explain it this way:*

We‚Äôre all born to a set of parents. If we‚Äôre fortunate, they love and care for us. Now, imagine someone asking you, ‚ÄúDo you believe those are your parents? ‚ÄùYour answer wouldn‚Äôt hinge on belief. It would be a core truth.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù you‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúI know they're my parents. There‚Äôs no belief involved.‚Äù That‚Äôs the key to defeating impostor syndrome: knowing who you are‚Äînot just believing.

The company will match my current salary + some, and give 0.5% ownership of the company. To me this feels a little bit low considering the risk and high amount of work to be expected from joining. But maybe I'm just entitled or think about it all wrong? 

The startup is doing it's first round of fundraising where 1% equals roughly $100 000. Funds are planned for a 2 year dev cycle before round 2. 

I'm being met by arguments that 0.5% is an amazing deal that most people would throw them selves at. But I can't really make myself see why it's so good given the high risk of any startup and that the four founders would have the lions share of earnings even after taking in round two of investments. 

Why would anyone want to join something that is statistically plausible to fail without having a significant share in the potential earnings? What deals do startups usually give the first batch of employees and what's expected of them? While it would be a high passion project for me I also live in the real world and want (very) high rewards if I take high risks. 

Perspectives and thoughts are very welcome. Do I need to get my head out of my posterior regions here? People who hire for startups, why do people usually join besides from it being passion projects?

Has anyone here had experience working with a fractional CTO? Were you able to successfully raise funds with this arrangement? How do investors and VCs generally perceive it? Are investors more open to fractional CTOs in early-stage startups, or do they generally see it as a red flag?

That means you need to give them founder‚Äôs equity. You are trying to avoid this, but it‚Äôs mostly unavoidable. This is the root of your problem.\n\nA fractional CTO isn‚Äôt an alternative to a full-time CTO, it‚Äôs a stepping stone. 10‚Äì15% is far too high for a fractional CTO and far too low for a full-time CTO. If you give a fractional CTO that much equity, it‚Äôs dead weight on the cap table. It will kill your ability to raise later rounds.\n\nThe goal of a fractional CTO in your case is to get you to the next stage while setting you up for the future without screwing things up. You need a plausible story for how you are going to fill the CTO role when you raise funding. Sometimes investors will be able to recommend somebody. Sometimes a fractional CTO will be willing to join full-time once you raise. But just staying with a fractional CTO indefinitely isn‚Äôt going to fly with investors. At the pre-seed stage, the team is a huge factor so a question mark where the CTO should be really hurts you.\n\nWhere a fractional CTO is badly needed is to make the tech decisions you can‚Äôt that are in your best interests, so you really need to pick one whose goals are aligned with yours. In this case, you either need somebody in consultant mode, or somebody who is interested in joining but won‚Äôt commit without funding. What you want to avoid are the ones who basically act as lead gen for their dev agency. Their goals are most definitely not aligned with your own.\n\nSo the profile you are looking for is somebody in an advisor role who will spend a limited amount of time each week steering things in the right direction. So give them an advisor‚Äôs equity and a day rate. Front-load a bit of the initial work, so maybe pay for a week of their time, then a day a week moving forward.', 'You‚Äôve already wasted a year‚Äôs worth of more rapid progress on being greedy, how much more time are you going to waste because you don‚Äôt want to share in success with others? Isn‚Äôt your time worth anything to you?

It‚Äôs anywhere from contractor software engineer that writes code to some kind of hands on executive coach\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt look like you need that. It looks like you need a partner.

You should go for agility (go wide) than perfect quality (go deep). You are no where in the position ‚Äúto scale‚Äù.', 'As a CPO and co founder, I used to hire an agency to do my MVP for 1 year.

I‚Äôve been working as a fractional CTO for about five years, so I‚Äôve seen this situation a lot. Honestly, having a fractional CTO is pretty normal for early-stage startups. Ofc depends on the domain, but typically investors don‚Äôt see it as a red flag as long as it‚Äôs clear how this setup helps you now and how you‚Äôll handle the transition to a full-time CTO down the line.\n\nThe key is to show that you‚Äôre not just winging it. Investors care more about execution and scalability than whether your CTO is fractional or full-time. If the person you bring on has solid experience, can manage the tech side effectively, and knows how to build a team, it won‚Äôt matter as much.\n\nA couple of tips:\n\n1. Be transparent with investors‚Äîexplain why this works for your startup now and how you plan to scale the team later.\n2. Choose a fractional CTO who‚Äôs been in the trenches before and can bring not just technical skills but also a network of engineers and advisors.\n3. Focus on delivering results.

More than likely there will be lots of other more serious issues to consider at this stage.', 'Thanks for your feedback and I think I missed the part that I‚Äôm keeping the equity because I haven‚Äôt found the right CTO.

No credible VC or CTO will join you before they know your MVP is something somebody wants and you know how to reach your target efficiently.

Curious about something and hoping to get your thoughts!  
I'm a bit of a podcast junkie (have spoken on a couple and easily consume 100+ a month), but lately, I've been hitting a wall finding short and good audio content that really scratches my specific interests.

So I've been experimenting with something: using AI tools to generate short, focused audio snippets about topics I'm genuinely curious about. Nothing too polished, just quick, informative 10-minute audio clips. And It's been surprisingly enjoyable!

I started thinking about building a quick prototype of an app (I'm an experienced software engineer) to do this for everybody: a daily 10min audio/podcast about either news or subjects of interest for people to listen to while commuting to work.

Assuming the audio/podcast quality is indistinguishable from real humans, would love to know:

1. Would you be more interested in hyper-personalized content about your specific interests, or quick daily news summaries?
2. What's the sweet spot for length? 10 min? 15?

* **Acquisition tactics:** Breakdown of specific methods these companies use to acquire leads effectively, including what worked, what failed, and why.
* **SaaS product highlights:** A showcase of different SaaS tools and solutions used by other founders to overcome roadblocks and accelerate growth.
* **Founder spotlights:** Stories from other SaaS founders on their biggest challenges, key learnings, and the strategies that helped them scale.
* **Problem-solving deep dives:** Practical solutions to common hurdles faced by SaaS startups, from improving lead conversion to reducing churn and boosting retention.

**My ask:**

* **Would you subscribe to this type of newsletter?** If so, what kind of value or content would make it a must-read for you each week?
* **What newsletters are you currently subscribed to (if any), and why do you enjoy them?**

Some of the most successful products out there didn‚Äôt start out polished - they launched early, learned from users, and adjusted along the way.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37f8d,1giuikn,EdTech Idea? Is this genius or stupid?,"TLDR: A platform where students create and use studyguides. And are paid commensurately to popularity/quality of their study guides.

My dad used to say I shouldn't work in school because ""college is a full time job"" but I always countered ""why do I not get paid"". I created countless pages of notes, quizletts that other students used, and for some courses like intro courses at uni the notes are pretty much the same and countless students take the course. This phenomenon already happens between friend groups but I want to moentize and mechanize it.

I want to create a platform that pays students for the work they are already doing. Namely taking notes, creating study guides, and finding the tricks to graduate easily and efficiently. It would ideally be a community like platfrom limited to students only (like reddit)... but at the very least a database of answers/ study guides/ and what not.

What would diffrentiate this community from other platforms is that it would be limited to current students. Quality notes would be added to the platform, if people needed those notes, acccess to them could be sold by the student that created them, and of course the platform would keep maybe a percentage and or  have subscription fees.

I've had this idea since highschool but I would love genuine feedback on whether it is a good idea and any counters/issues you guys may see with it.

1. Maintaing quality notes/study guides and creating an automated system to recieve and review them

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f5f,1gk8518,Unsure how to manage co-founder issues,"Reason I'm writing here is that I'd like to be challenged on the below, and see a perspective I might be missing.

Long story-short, I'm a fairly senior Enterprise IT Sales Director, and I've recently joined forces with a former co-worker a very talented Head of Delivery, from one of my previous jobs, and started a Staff Augmentation business, focused on senior IT professionals. 

He's focused on the people, I should be focused on bringing in new business. Easy, right?

He was looking to join forces with smb in sales, I was looking for a new opportunity. We matched our interest. We were talking about a partnership with equal rights, so evenly split. I then learned he already had one customer with whom he had an engagement of 15FTE (meaning is less important than the number). So it made sense that I should bring in an equal amount to start in the partnership.  So we agreed to continue on his company that already had some financial history, which has benefits in new business.

Initial results from my work started to appear after 5 months from our kick-off as ""partners"".

What I did not take into account is that reaching the same level as his will take longer than anticipated. 1 year+ versus 6 months initially( had this timeframe in my mind). Reasons for this are both objective and subjective. Meanwhile, his customer doubled in volume and value, which made my entry-point uncertain.

So at one point I raise the issue of needing to have some long-term security for the time I'm investing in promoting this brand, this business, so I propose that instead of an equal entrance point into the partnership, we sign a deal where I could become gradually a partner, proportionally to the business I bring in, compared to his one customer, up to a 50% cap. 

Surprisingly, this was a shock to him as he was still expecting to reach the agreed initial term of me reaching 15FTE. So insisted we should still wait for that marker to happen. However, new information, he was no longer willing to do a partnership that involves his customer, since ""that's his own money/work"". 

Additionally, he aluded to a mechanics that meant my shares in the company should diminish below 50% if, at one point, under yet-to-be-established criteria, I don't bring as much business anymore. He dropped it when I mentioned that's not equal partnership.

At one point, without proper thought, he even suggested that we split the business I bring in at 50% and the business he brings in, stays his forever. Also dropped it for obvious reasons.

Have to say that I mentioned, and still stand-by the fact that I'm not interested in the money he made with his own customer in the past. I proposed that I enter gradually in the company, proportionally, and that the company signs a contract with him by which it will pay him an amount equal to the profit the company's made in the past, from his customer, before me joining. However future customers are split.

The conversation reached a stale-mate, and I have to pick it up again. I'm not sure what a fair solution would be? Anyone has any ideas?

(Not to mention that this situation severely eroded my trust, I am now second-guessing everything I'm doing, and I'm fighting demotivation and disorientation.)

**This is my first post, so please if I'm crossing the rules tell me and I remove it.**

**Introduction and Context:**

I created an open-source project casually, mostly to aggregate my code for medium articles. Eventually became a niche open-source project, that at this point, gives me steady contractor work.

Is used already by multiple companies, from Big consulting companies to FAANG (as internal, small use cases for now).

The thing is: **I think is a fantastic project to have your name in, but not big enough to expand.**

Some startups raised VC capital and did something related, even at a smaller scale, but I think doesn't make sense given the project.

Question:

So, I want to create a new startup (with other members), not directly related.

1. Will VC's get skeptical of me having ""something on the side""?
2. Not scaling something with 1k stars on Github (eventually), a waste?
3. Will be perceived as positive and proof of skill?

TL:DR: I have a moderately successful open-source project, but I want to start a startup not directly related. Is there a way to capitalize the project somehow?

I have a background in Mechanical Engineering/Robotics (both undergrad and grad school), and I taught myself coding. I‚Äôm currently working in the Bay Area at a cutting-edge company in computer vision research, although I‚Äôm just starting to dive deeper into it.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on a few things as I plan for the future:

**1. How did people in similar situations make the jump into doing a startup?**  
I know I have the potential to start a company, and I really want to do it eventually, but I feel I need to work on myself a bit more before jumping in. The problem is, I don't have a strong financial situation (though I‚Äôm building it now). My family has only been debt-free for the last few years, and I was able to secure funding during my master's. That said, I want to make sure I‚Äôm ready both technically and financially. For those of you who‚Äôve made the leap into starting a business from a tech career, how did you make that transition? How did you deal with the financial challenges?

**2. How do startup founders balance having a deep technical understanding, market awareness, and competition insight?**  
One of the challenges I‚Äôm facing is how startup people have a solid understanding of the technical side of things *and* the market, competition, and business strategy. I want to be able to have the technical knowledge to build something meaningful, but I also need to understand the larger context. How do founders typically get a good understanding of both?

**3. How do you keep up with trends in the ML field?**  
This one is specific to my current focus: Machine Learning, especially in the realm of computer vision and reasoning. I‚Äôve been struggling to keep up with the trends in the field and feel like my understanding of core concepts is still lacking. I know I need to improve my discipline and push myself to learn more, but it‚Äôs a steep curve. How do you guys keep up with fast-evolving technologies, particularly in ML? Do you have any resources, routines, or strategies that have helped you self-improve?

**4. How can I leverage my current job at a good company for future goals?**  
I‚Äôm working in a cutting-edge company for computer vision research right now, though I don‚Äôt work directly on the computer vision aspect yet. I‚Äôm still just getting started. How can I leverage my position in a high-tech company to build my knowledge, grow my network, and prepare for a future startup? What‚Äôs the best way to use this environment to my advantage while still focusing on building my own business?

**Summary**:

* I want to start a company in the future, but I‚Äôm still building up my technical skills and financial situation.
* I‚Äôm currently working in computer vision/ML, but I want to deepen my understanding and stay on top of trends.
* I struggle with self-discipline and staying focused when working alone, but I know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs necessary for a startup.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37ce3,1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built?

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cf3,1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *‚ÄúWhy not try making my own dream come true?‚Äù*. That‚Äôs when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn‚Äôt easy. I didn‚Äôt make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren‚Äôt being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lifesaver!‚Äù* That‚Äôs when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I‚Äôve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It‚Äôs been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I‚Äôve started working on another extension for Claude, which I‚Äôm hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

A YouTuber mentioned that having a working Stripe integration gives a better impression, so I added it to my apps, transforming them into SaaS models.

To fix this, I built FeatureFlow for my own projects to gather instant and better feedback. Then i decided to launched it on Product Hunt and ended up getting ""PRODUCT OF THE DAY 2nd PLACE"", I was so happy, months and months of work finally paid off.

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre a D2C e-commerce dropshipping business focused on tech and scalability with a patent-pending platform. We operate with a lean model‚Äîno inventory risk, just pure tech enablement.
	‚Ä¢	Historically, we‚Äôve achieved $75M in sales, and after pivoting away from an old Amazon-dependent model, we‚Äôre now selling exclusively on our own website.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre currently generating $450K/month in revenue with 32.5% gross margins. We‚Äôve hit 6 consecutive months of profitability and are continuing to grow.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve served over 160,000 customers, with an average order value of $175, and have garnered over 18,000 positive customer reviews.

What We‚Äôre Looking to Do:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre aiming to raise $2M through either a growth investor or a convertible note to accelerate our growth and scale further.
	‚Ä¢	The capital will allow us to optimize our existing debt and improve our cash flow, positioning us for faster growth and a potential larger equity round in the near future.

The Obstacle:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre currently optimizing about $1.75M in legacy debt, which costs us around $20K/month in legal fees, principal, interest, and debt settlements.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve made significant strides, including settling a $2M supplier debt down to $800K, and restructuring payments with other financial partners to ease cash flow.
	‚Ä¢	However, we‚Äôre hitting a wall‚Äîmany investors see us as either too big for seed funding or too small for growth capital. This makes it challenging to get responses, even though we‚Äôre profitable and growing.

Looking for Advice:

	1.	How can we optimize our outreach to get responses from growth investors or convertible note providers? What strategies have worked for you in getting their attention?
	2.	Are there specific firms, family offices, or investors that focus on companies in our stage‚Äîprofitable but still scaling?
	3.	What are the best channels for outreach (cold emails, LinkedIn, warm intros, etc.)? Any tips on structuring these messages to increase engagement?

We‚Äôre confident in the strength of our business model and the growth potential of our current pivot, but we‚Äôre having trouble getting in front of the right investors who can see the value we‚Äôre bringing.

Any insights, introductions, or strategies would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time and advice!",0,startups,1731556398.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gqw5so/75_l12_lean_profitable_raising_with_legacy_debt/,experience,"['You‚Äôre not asking for enough.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d66,1h0i121,8 Months as 1st Employee at Pre-PMF Startup ‚Äì Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been struggling in my current role and could use some advice.

In March 2024, I joined a very early-stage startup as the first employee and Growth Lead. Before this, I was the first Growth hire at a successful startup with a similar business model but in a different industry. While the salary here is decent for the company stage, it‚Äôs nowhere near my previous salary.

Lately, I‚Äôve started to lose motivation and confidence in the company and the founders. Here‚Äôs why:

The founders are slow to make decisions, especially on strategic priorities. Urgent matters are discussed in meetings but rarely followed up with action.  
  
I seem to be the only one implementing processes and ensuring the team sticks to them. For example, we have a cold-calling session with the Sales team, but if I‚Äôm not actively involved and making sure it happens, no one does it. The founder in charge of Sales doesn‚Äôt seem to care.

It‚Äôs a mobile app, but there‚Äôs no CTO or technical founder. Development is outsourced to an agency, resulting in sporadic feature releases. Communication with the agency has become increasingly difficult, and most releases come with significant bugs.

The founders‚Äô mood is worsening, and they seem increasingly overwhelmed, mostly due to cash flow concerns and underwhelming performance metrics.

I was initially promised 2% equity, but after a board meeting, it was revised to 1%. I still haven‚Äôt signed the paperwork as I'm waiting for them to give me the contract... They also revised my bonus to only give me the smallest tier, even though they say my performance was great.

I can‚Äôt control how the business performs, but it feels like my career is tied to its success. I‚Äôm losing motivation as my confidence in the leadership and company vision declines and ultimately I feel underpaid for everything I'm doing and how much effort I put in the startup...  
  
Is there anything I can do to improve the situation, or should I start looking elsewhere?

Cheers!",2,startups,1732643649.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h0i121/8_months_as_1st_employee_at_prepmf_startup_need/,question,['I would tell them that if they want results they need to start doing a. b. and c.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c8e,1h892yq,"I launched my MVP, started with the sales. This is what I found out:","Spoiler: I am not able to make a sale, and I don't see it as a bad thing.

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

I thought to post it on LinkedIn, but Reddit is where the real talk is.",8,startups,1733512163.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h892yq/i_launched_my_mvp_started_with_the_sales_this_is/,experience,"[""This is a fantastic case study in pivoting based on real-world feedback.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ecf,1gojw8p,Rate my idea: Digital Workplace Wellness Platform,"I've been struggling to come up with my next project; I was lying in bed last night and thought about my current job's wellness program and how the majority of my colleagues don't utilize it (they pay for our gym membership if we go x amount per month)

I came up with a potential solution...Today, I created a landing page to gauge interest and filmed a video with a local fitness instructor (it's on the site)

**Potential Problem:** Employee wellness programs often include gym memberships and other out-of-office benefits. While it's great for some employees, it's ignoring a large portion of the workforce who isn't interested in dedicating the time to go to the gym, has kids and can't, etc.  
  
**My Idea:** OffiHealth is an online platform that produces bite-sized guided videos such as stretching, exercises, and meditations. These videos are 10 minutes long; everything can be done in a small office space.

**Why employers should care:** Studies have shown that workplace wellness programs can significantly impact employee productivity, job satisfaction, and overall health. A Harvard Business Review study found that mindfulness meditation can increase focus and productivity by up to 40%. Additionally, research from the Mayo Clinic indicates that regular exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mental health, and reduce absenteeism.

I am currently a junior in college. I previously, in highschool and at the start of college, ran an Etsy 3D Printing store. I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea. Over the past 3 years, I have had multiple Venture Capital and Incubator internships, working at some pretty large VCs, one having $500M in AUM. I have learned a lot through these internships, specifically on the deal sourcing side and raising side, and I think I would make a really valuable non-technical founder. I also have gained a really strong network of potential capital raisers, and my dad is a lawyer who works with Startups and Venture Capital firms to raise money.

However, I realize that I need to focus on product, acquiring customers, and proving that there is a demand for my e-commerce platform. I am apprehensive about reaching out to my network of VCs for mentoring/advice in case I want to raise with them in the future. My dad has been really supportive but has more experience in the raising aspect, and I am apprehensive about asking him to leverage his network because I am afraid of ruining his reputation (which is very good in his field/area).

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains ‚Äì this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d8a,1gzfv9t,Best way to test a product before bulk manufacturing?,"Just before anything, I am somewhat new to E-Commerce so any information would be helpful!



I have a very good product idea, but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. I want to try to test the market of this product to see if there is demand for it. This product does not exist anywhere and its a very simple product that I think should exist but doesn't. I have also been using this product like this for years and a quick Google search shows that others have too, but I can't gauge how many and it seems like it isn't a lot. 



However, now that I am working on it I notice that it is a lot harder to produce and a bit more expensive than I would've anticipated. It is an overall simple product just I will not be able to design and make it on my own but I know the product works.

  
What would be the best way to test the product like this before manufacturing? As I said, I want to ensure there is demand in this product before investing a good amount of money into it. 



My current thought process is to find a manufacturer nearby and ask if they can make the product and order a few samples. The product and packaging will be extremely basic and I plan to build a quick website, run ads and compare people who entered the site and bought the samples. This idea does seem expensive as I would need to order a lot of samples, pay an R&amp;D team to develop the product to ensure it works as intended, get a good website working and pay for advertisement as well so I was wondering if there is a cheaper alternative to this that I can do.

Or there's more to it? If the church had instead written that solo founder is holy grail, would you still continue with your Co founders ? And risk going against the investors bible?

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ef4,1gnaztf,Do you really need to talk to 50 people before working on a product?,"# Do you really need to talk to 50 people before working on a product?

Nope. Let me show you why through a practical example.

I recently worked with founders building tools for small sales teams. Everyone told them to ""talk to at least 50 salespeople."" But here's what actually happened when they focused on just 12 of the right people instead.

When founders chase ""50 interviews"" here's the mess that happens:

- They talk to anyone willing to give feedback
- They accept input from people who ""used to do sales""
- They drown in conflicting opinions
- They hear unhelpful advice like ""Just use Salesforce better!""
- Their notes become a jungle of contradictions
- They end up more confused than when they started

Here's why: If ten sales reps managing 20+ deals each quarter are trying to stay on top of follow-ups, they're probably:

- Using some combo of spreadsheets and calendar reminders
- Hitting identical walls with pipeline visibility
- Creating matching workarounds between tools
- Wishing for a way to know which deals need attention now

By conversation 12 with the right people, you'll be finishing their sentences. That's not coincidence. That's pattern recognition.

The usual traps that lead to bad research:

1\. The investor trap when investors push for ""more research,"" they connect you with:

- A VP of Sales who hasn't managed a pipeline since 2015
- An advisor who ""scaled multiple sales teams""
- A sales director who has their SDR handle follow-ups
- Other founders who ""built a sales tool once""

2\. The random sample trap

- Mixing active sales reps with ""anyone in revenue""
- Getting vague feedback like ""Most reps would probably...""
- Hearing generic opinions like ""Just add AI to everything""
- Counting coffee chats as customer research

What makes someone ""right""?

- They're managing 15-25 deals right NOW
- They've tried Salesforce, Hubspot, and countless spreadsheets
- They can show you their morning follow-up routine
- They have quota to hit this quarter

You've found your pattern when:

- You know they're using a separate spreadsheet before they mention it
- You can guess their Monday morning process
- Their frustrations with missed follow-ups sound familiar
- More interviews just confirm what you already know

Here's the truth: 50 random opinions will give you 50 different directions. 12 conversations with sales reps actively juggling deals will show you one clear path.

Stop diluting your insights with quantity. Start focusing on quality. Your product will thank you.",30,startups,1731161688.0,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gnaztf/do_you_really_need_to_talk_to_50_people_before/,question,"[""You don't need to talk to anyone.

I have an idea for a website and would like to make a clickable prototype. Mainly to validate and to show people my idea (it is considered quite abstract for those not in the niche field so will make it easier to explain).  

What is the best way to do this? 

I have not created a website in years so am essentially a complete beginner and so would like to use a website builder that is drag and drop and easy to make it look pretty.  

It will have a giant menu and I need to be able to change the menu (add/remove subsections) easily. I also need to be able to add in a clickable map that has an action once clicked, and the option to add and export PowerPoint files and Excel files.  

I was thinking of using Elementor Pro to build it mainly because it looks relatively easy (although I have zero experience with it) and has the map plugin and mega menu plugin.  

The website will be built from scratch at a later date, this clickable prototype is only for explaining and validating with potential users.

Anyone got any other recommendations?

After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here‚Äôs the truth: sales isn‚Äôt about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I‚Äôve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50‚Äì100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer‚Äôs pain points.
4. **Don‚Äôt Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return‚Äîlike a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you‚Äôre not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you‚Äôre flying blind.

However, I was wondering why no one has ventured into offering different pricing tiers based on the¬†**number of posts**¬†users can make each month.

# Here‚Äôs my thought process:

* **Metered Pricing**: This model would allow users to have¬†**unlimited social profiles**¬†but limit them to the number of posts they can schedule. I'm trying to target mid-sized agencies and b2b businesses. Of course, I'll create 2-3 different tiers based on different feature sets, too.

# Questions for You:

* Have you encountered any sm management platform using a metered pricing model based on post limits?
* What are your thoughts on the potential benefits or drawbacks of this approach?
* How do you think this model compares to the traditional profile-based pricing in terms of flexibility and usability for agencies?
* Are there specific pain points you believe could be addressed with a metered pricing model?

I‚Äôm eager to hear your insights and experiences regarding this idea.

**Disclaimer**: I run a social media management tool and am considering updating my pricing strategy to test this metered approach. However, I wanted to gather opinions from this community before making any changes.

I'm in the early stages of building an MVP for my startup, and could really use some advice and encouragement from this amazing community.

A bit about my startup: My company is focused on revolutionizing agricultural trade and beyond. Our vision is to empower smallholder farmers by connecting them with global buyers through a blockchain-integrated web portal.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.
It's been a challenge balancing the development costs while maintaining the momentum of the project.

What I'm looking for:

Advice on getting investors after completing the MVP: For those of you who've been here before, how did you approach investors at this stage? What worked for you?

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

First-time technical founder here. Two years ago, I decided to leave the 9-5 grind and build something meaningful. Now, I have (what I believe is) a brilliant technical solution but no clear business case. I‚Äôm seeking a cofounder with product and marketing expertise to help pivot my project into a viable business - or start a new one. Details below.

**About Me**

* 36yo, born in Berlin and moved to San Francisco 8 years ago
* Master's in Software Engineering with 15 years of experience
* Worked with early-stage startups in Berlin and a venture studio in SF
* Spent the past years leading a team of 12 shipping enterprise software 

**The tech I've built**

An AI engine that makes it easy for developers to automate their workflows. It works with code, issues, PRs and integrates with 3rd party systems like error trackers, wikis, ticketing systems, etc. It takes natural language instructions, fulfills them autonomously and responds with a result. The functionality is served as a platform, with an API and an SDK. On top of it, I've built a CLI and a web application with productivity tools for developers.

**Who and what I'm looking for**

My main goal is to leave my current job and build a company around a problem that matters to me, ideally with considerable equity. I‚Äôm looking for:

* **A cofounder** with product and marketing expertise who sees potential in my tech and can help turn it into a successful business‚Äîor someone with a strong business case who needs a technical founder.
* **Mentorship** from someone experienced in dev tool startups or as a successful solo founder. I‚Äôd love to learn from your journey and would be happy to offer my technical expertise or collaborate on projects in return.

Some people just aren‚Äôt open to new things; don‚Äôt waste your time there. But realistic skeptics‚Äîpeople with specific concerns‚Äîare gold. They‚Äôll tell you where the friction is: trust, usability, ROI?\n2. **Address ‚ÄúToo Good to Be True‚Äù** \\- When people say it seems ‚Äútoo good to be true,‚Äù dig into that.

Early adopters who see and value the product will give you feedback and, later on, be strong advocates.

Which can only be done via social proof.', 'This is something I\'ve run into and thought about a bit\n\n1. Conventional marketing/product wisdom is that you can break users into a kind of normal distribution from a small number of people ""extremely willing to try new products"" (""enthusiasts"", ""early adopters"", ""innovators""), to people who are willing to try new products with a bit of convincing (and who you may need to invest in marketing to reach, since they\'re not as much ""enthusiasts), to the bulk of people who need varying degrees of signal/social/technical proof that it\'s worth trying, to people who are increasingly reluctant and averse to trying new things. So it helps to focus on the ones you can win over and leave the increasingly reluctant ones for later - they need more convincing and social proof (eg wider adoption) before they\'ll react to your product positively.\n\n2. Portray your product realistically and authentically. Anybody who has dabbled in GenAI products knows that there will be some rate of jank stemming from models not being perfect, having limitations, etc. So you definitely should highlight places your product doesn\'t work yet, how to handle situations in which it produces output you\'re not happy with (you should design your product to handle this well because it WILL happen), etc. and demonstrate it to people in a way that doesn\'t feel ""cherry-picked"" or ""rehearsed"". In a recorded demo maybe you include a situation in which it messes up and you fix it (after first showing how nice it is on the ""happy path""), in a 1:1 demo you ask the user for input, etc.\n\n3. Make it as easy as possible to demo or try using your product. This is something I\'m investing a ton in for my product because it\'s the only way to scale actually ""proving"" that your product works. If your product is so amazing that it seems too good to be true and makes potential users very skeptical, even requiring eg setting up a free trial introduces enough friction that skeptical will find it not worth it.\n\n4. Create instructional material, onboarding features, etc. to make it easier for people to start using your product. IMO a lot of times skepticism and reluctance is not actually motivated by your product\'s quality so much as a personal reluctance to abandon old skills/ways of doing things to start using something new (especially if the new thing isn\'t THAT much easier or better than before). There are actually many interesting things you can do here like setting up ""champion"" programs, hosting events, doing onsite hands on demos, etc beyond just creating docs and videos.', 'I found that if are able to somehow address their concerns and convert them, these types of people will usually be your best and most loyal customers.']"

As founders, we often wear multiple hats‚Äîvisionary, manager, marketer, and even developer. But one of the toughest challenges I‚Äôve faced (and seen others face) is managing time effectively. Here are three strategies that have helped me stay focused and productive:

1. Prioritize ruthlessly: Not all tasks are created equal. I use the 80/20 rule to focus on the 20% of tasks that drive 80% of results. For example, spending time on customer feedback is usually more impactful than tweaking internal processes.

2. Time blocking: I block specific hours for deep work, meetings, and even breaks. By giving structure to my day, I avoid the trap of reacting to every notification or email.

3. Delegate and automate: It‚Äôs tempting to do everything yourself, but as your business grows, you need to trust your team and invest in tools that automate repetitive tasks. This frees up your time for strategic thinking.

Founders often feel like there‚Äôs never enough time, but learning to manage it well is a superpower. Remember: your time is one of your most valuable resources.

Hey everyone,

A few days ago, I finished my business plan for a startup! I‚Äôm studying intercultural business psychology, so I have some background in marketing and sales structures. I can quickly learn about new topics and have a good sense of the big picture. Now I‚Äôm looking to dive deeper into the world of startups to bring my project to life.

My questions for you:

    How can I verify if my concept is technically feasible? Are there resources or people I could reach out to for guidance?

When somebody approaches you (or you approach them) about being co-founders, your knee jerk reaction should be ""no"".

Really, it's ""no, not right now, maybe later, we'll see how it goes.""

Then, set up a regular meeting 1x or 2x a month and act as if you have separate businesses who just share ideas.  I've filtered out so many flakes and people who have 0 business sense this way.  Most people are unreliable or useless and they show it in the first few meetings.  A few people are even OK but just not good or serious enough to be co-founders with.

Then, do a little partnership deal.  Do a little brochure website together, co-sell your separate ideas to the same potential customer or run $100 ad campaign together.  Ask them to pay for something.  Take them for a test drive.  When I get to this point with somebody, I often find that they are unreliable, incompetent, dumb or just cheapskates.  Then, I just end the deal.

I'd recommend a 4 year vesting schedule, with a 1 year cliff, as that is pretty standard. Some people have acceleration clauses in their contract, which cover things like selling the company. The c-suite usually has more provisions tied to their options, as they are integral members of the company. A buyer usually doesn't want to incentivize the people building a successful company to leave it, so an exit might require renegotiation, where the buyer mandates a new agreement with new terms.  \n  \nYou also need to think about how to continue to reward stellar results. A startup might require 10 years to get to a worthwhile exit. You don't want your CTO gone after four. If they want 10% of the company, start them at 5%. As long as they are performing well each year, then give them another 1% as a bonus (which vests over 4 years). Say your company had a million shares, this is what it would look like:\n\nYear 1: Offered 50,000 options. 1 year cliff, no options unlocked.  \nYear 2. Offered additional 10,000 to unlock over 4 years. 12,500 unlocked day 1 of year 2.

Then 1/48 unlocked each month from the 50,000 and the 10,000 (1250 ea month).   \nYear 4: Offered additional 10,000. 2,500 unlocked on day 1 of year 4. They're now at 1/48 of 50k, 10k, 10k (1458 ea month).  \nYear 5: Offered additional 10,000. 2,500 unlocked on day 1 of year 5. They've vested their original 50k.

They are still at 625 shares ea month.\n\nThis is what it might look like on paper, but reality will likely be very different. If you raise additional funding, some of those rounds may be dilutive. The same shares will be worth a smaller portion of the company. If that happens in year 3, then maybe you start giving the CTO 20k shares instead of 10k, but it equals out because there are now maybe 20 million shares of the company. You raise because you believe even if you dilute your ownership, the company will be worth 10x down the road. Some folks will ask for their shares to be full ratchet, meaning they have their ownership diluted. That's very unusual though, and would only be for a small amount of ownership in the company.""]"

Critics, admirers of Seurat, show up one by one, justifying the laser show, ‚Äútimes change so quickly‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the challenge of our work, you never which movement is going to hit next, which artist to embrace.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat is the state of the art, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 

	Building a startup, like creating art, is full of moments of uncertainty, doubt, and resistance, full of critics coming at our work from different backgrounds and perspectives. They‚Äôre either ready to embrace the endeavor with electronic deposits or drive a stake right through the canvas. All the while, we have this vision of what we‚Äôre trying to create, but it‚Äôs messy. And we‚Äôre the only ones who can hold onto that vision even when it feels impossible. There‚Äôs the grind, the sacrifices, and endless nights wondering if it‚Äôs all worth it.

	The thing is, this struggle is the process. Just like in art, startups are about more than the end product‚Äîthey‚Äôre about everything we pour into them along the way.

	If you‚Äôre curious, the song is called ‚ÄúFinishing the Hat.‚Äù The clip I found has the title: ‚ÄúPutting it together.‚Äù Maybe give it a search on YouTube and see if it resonates. I really liked Mandy Patinkin‚Äôs performance.

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ed2,1gofu5o,Finding a 1-2 engineer pre-funding? (FE &amp; BE/prompt),"Hi everyone, posting this question for my very talented entrepreneur friend, u/Cloud_Dev_Env, who's looking for advice on early-stage bootstrapping. I asked him to elaborate on his business idea to help identify best solutions. In his words: 

\------

Hi all, I'm trying to figure out how to recruit talented folks pre-funding.

We're two founders looking to streamline engineering ops and help teams meet milestones by building a reconciliation engine across Slack, Jira, Zoom, Github and more. Engineering leaders and managers spend hours on 1-on-1s , dailies , yet fire-drills are a constant part of their day. Developers are stuck or blocked, scope creep, PRs are pending too long and miscommunication are some of the reasons for that. We believe the data is there and we want to extract its meaning and make it accessible.¬†

Lots of LLMs, working with embeddings and vectors. Super interesting and lots of opportunities to learn and contribute.¬†

We interviewed 100 prospective users (engineering leaders) just with our rough first draft and already had several clear notices of interest. Our CTO is amazing (VP Eng himself) but we don't feel like we're moving fast enough on the MVP. It‚Äôs a big challenge for just one person.¬†

We thought it would be better to have at least one frontend engineer (big gap between our Figma and the functionality as well as current UI) and another backend or prompt engineer to help make sense of all the data we are gathering. I'm just not sure about the best place to find these engineers when we're pre-funding?¬†

Prior startups we did were VC backed. This is our first time taking a different approach and bootstrapping it to the first customers hence Looking for advice!¬†¬†

I'd also love to talk to anyone looking for a new venture to join, but would not want folks to feel like I'm asking for work for free. Other details: we're a 2-person team, roughly 8 months old, the core MVP is there, including integrations to the various communication channels but we did a lot of hacks for demos and now need to build a real product.

We can offer equity at this point and an opportunity to make an impact on the product, with a competitive salary once we raise our first round.

My tech startup was founded just over 2 years ago. We started on a quasi-agency model, hand coding our product with full service for large B2B clients.

By the end of last year, we crossed $1MM ARR and grew to about 15 staff. We aren‚Äôt big on credentials so had a small friend-adjacent seed fund to give us stability.

Using all that we learned in manually delivering our product, we developed a full SaaS platform over a year and a half, and automated our own workload. Now all new delivery is done using the platform for the last 3 months, dramatically simplifying things.

The idea is now to transition to full SaaS, while maintaining a white glove branch. We got our first self-signed subscribing client last week, $66/mo.

We‚Äôre closing the year soon, having just crossed $2MM ARR this week, 30 staff, 130 clients.

But this growth rate is without SaaS! With our platform battle hardening and maturing into something I‚Äôm genuinely proud of, it will be very exciting to see where it takes us in the next several months.

So I think I'm in a pretty good position to explain whats going on here.\n\nVCs work on the 2 and 20 model, which means they have 2% of their total fund size as operating capital to work with. As a rough estimate there are about 5,000 funds today actively deploying capital, with about $200M per fund, on average. 2% of that spread across the three year average lifecycle of a fund means the fund has about $1.3M to work with per year. That average fund has, lets say, a GP, 2 principals, and 2 analysts. Thats roughly $1M in payroll per year. Add in that slick downtown NYC or SF office- thats another $200K per year. That leaves about 100k per year for incidentals, and since the VC can't spend their full incidentals budget on your product, they can spend at most, say $20K.\n\nSo $20K for 5000 funds- thats a $100M TAM. On a good day.\n\nHere's the thing- most VCs wont lift a finger for anything less than a $1B TAM. It simply doesn't have the market potential to make it worth their while.\n\nAnd here's another thing- lets assume your customers actually find your product valuable (a big IF), they know, because they happen to be VCs, that you will never raise capital because of the TAM.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37d01,1h4daw1,Is a patent or IP necessary?,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm building a startup in the healthcare field. I wrote the code during a research year in medical school. I wasn‚Äôt enrolled and the school has already said they won‚Äôt claim any ownership of the Intellectual Property. 

But a lot of my mentors, who are physicians so aren‚Äôt familiar with software startups, advised me to pursue a patent. I‚Äôve heard that software is impossible to patent and usually a copyright is good enough. 

My school, while currently not claiming ownership of the software, says that they are happy to pay the ~$30,000 required to file the patent/IP paperwork as long as I give them full rights to it. 

I don‚Äôt want to do that, especially since I have other investors who are happy to cover those costs while only wanting some equity in the company. 

My question is do I really need to file for an IP? If not, what would prevent another company from coming in and doing the same thing I‚Äôm trying to do? Other than not having the credibility among the customer base or other external factors like that.

It's more a status thing then, and that's fine, but I doubt that it'll give you a lot of other advantages beyond that.\n\nAlso, note that probably both are not great ideas: If your school has the patent, well, great, why would they want to be interested in that? I mean, what's in it for them if they don't get equity in the startup or anything like that? Or would your startup have to pay them a fee afterwards to use the patent? But VC is same: by registering a patent you already owe them 30k without having created anything more tangible at all. You've already given away some of the control in your own future startup for - well - a patent.\n\nIn case you do not have a time pressure to register the patent: Why don't you first start the startup without the patent and try to acquire some customers.

You can get a patent on software. It will almost certainly not matter unless the thing you are doing is highly technical and specific. They are sometimes useful to have. Also they should cost a lot less than $30k. I would probably advise against getting a patent at your stage, but since we don\'t know what it is, it is hard to say. Depending on what it is, customers might care a little and it might give you some credibility. But it will take you probably a year to get it if you fast track it, so it probably doesn\'t matter.\n\n  \n3. IP doesn\'t really matter much in software start-ups. You need to build something and get customers. If you do that you have a chance to succeed. If you don\'t, well, IP is unlikely to make any difference. So build it and sell it. \n\n  \n4. If you have real VCs interested, I would ignore a lot of the anti-VC comments and seriously consider it. It will help you build the business.

Hypothetical.... You're building out a services company that requires a lot of tech to operate at scale and meet margin objectives.   There are no complete off the shelf solutions because your IP is a very differentiated approach to the market.  There are however point solutions that can be PART of your platform.  

The company is B to B and B to C.  Think Healthcare with insurance companies and patients/clients.  
  
You narrow your platform choices down to either a Salesforce centric model, using their capabilities and app store integrated partners.  Or.

How do I structure early conversations to get genuine feedback? (I have picked up the Mom test to help with that aspect)

I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster. 

But most importantly, I know have a strong feeling, I'm building something meaningful.

Second time, go to those niche communities and see what problems they have, and do they pay someone to solve those problems ?

Third time, go to the Google keyword planner and see results on topics in which you are interested. Just go to Google and paste them. You will see relevant answers, are they good enough ? Do someone make from it ? If yes, go to the pricing section and see on what things they focus.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37eef,1gnjsp3,How would you start a product based startup if you did it all over again? Step by step guide please üôè.,"I am planning to start a product based startup. I have a very clear vision of how the product will be. But I know nothing about starting a startup or manufacturing a product. 

My question is to all the product based company owners. How would you start a product based startup if you started all over again?

Some details about me for context: 
I am a Fresher Software Developer who has no idea about product creation or management. I saw a market gap and thought of a practical product which in my opinion has a good scope for sale seeing the market gap. I know that it can be done in China, but I am not sure how to pull this off. I don't even have any seed money to put in this. 

What would you have done if you were in my situation?

What systems and human resources do I need to set in place to get my company started and working properly for creating and selling this product?

The rough plan that I have is to somehow get the seed money (from incubator or Kickstarter or something) and contact a Chinese manufacturing company to make the product, and then sell on Amazon, Flipkart or Alibaba. 

To understand the process first, I am thinking of making a test product (dummy product which is already established in market and sure to sell..... like a doorbell or a handfan or a Type C charger) in a small quantity (50 - 100 pieces) and sell on Amazon. And I will do this test with my own money. After understanding the process, I am thinking of approaching the investors or incubators for seed funding for the real product.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37ded,1gvvaug,First timer. Cold feet?,"I‚Äôm looking for advice or anyone else who has experienced a similar situation. 

*Context* 

I stumbled upon a problem in the marketing and content asset management space. While there are some solutions that solve the problem in fragments, I was sure a holistic approach would work. I set out to build a product prototype in Bubble.io. 

I showed the idea and the WIP prototype to a few angel investors and they loved it. They‚Äôre willing to invest in getting this product out quickly and into the hands of customers. However, I‚Äôve held them off saying I‚Äôd like to get the prototype in the hands of a few users and gauge their feedback. If there are viable signs of PMF, I‚Äôd love to take their investment and scale this rocket ship. 

I completed the prototype and I was my first customer. I LOVE my product and I genuinely believe this solves a ton of problems for me. 

I was invested in this build for nearly 3 months, so I decided to take a week‚Äôs break before I started putting this in the hands of my peers for user feedback. 

*The Problem* 

Now that I‚Äôm back from my break, I just can‚Äôt get myself to start handing it out. The cold feet stems from a simple fear: have I been drinking my own Kool Aid ? What if others don‚Äôt see the value the way I see it?

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d6f,1h09972,Building a platform to automate any internal operation workflow‚Ä¶.,"Hi everybody! I‚Äôve recently thrown myself back to pursuing a new venture after having done it once. It‚Äôs been 3 months since the last, so definitely feels addictive and exciting :)

**So what problem am I trying to solve ?**

The problem I‚Äôm trying to solve is something that I experienced so many times in my previous venture, both internally and whilst working with 3rd party partners. And that‚Äôs the common challenge of internal manual ops workflows that although not part of the core IP tend to have the following negative impacts:

* Lost of customers - typically as the result of slow internal processes e.g slow customer service support
* Large operational overheard - manual workflows often requires large head counts which is costly or sometimes simply infeasible
* Costly mistake and poor collaboration - manual workflows can often lead to costly mistakes and poor collaboration between teams.

**What‚Äôs the solution ?**

Well the solution to many of these manual workflows tends to be automation, however this is not always easy because of challenges such as:

* Inadequate tooling - tools like Zapier (have used it myself) are great but more tailored workflows tend to require custom code which can be tricky with these type of tools
* Different needs for different teams - each team has unique workflows and build custom automations for each team is infeasible
* Not part of engineering priorities - engineering is often focused on product requirements and doesn‚Äôt have time for internal tools

**What am I building to solve this ?**

An AI-powered platform that allows you yo automate any operational workflow simply by drawing and describing the process workflow.

So imagine all those nitty gritty manual tasks that are either costing you time or money, with what we are building no matter how custom it is, if you can draw the process workflow, describe it, the platform will give you an automated version of it which you can then deploy internally just with the push of a button. We want to make it simple for day-to-day founders and small business to custom automations with no coding or expertise required.

I would love to engage with anyone who would love to be apart of the beta testing as we ramp up the first version (schedule for release after the Christmas break). Moreover I would love your feedback on the above, what uses-cases would you want to automate on such a platform.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d5e,1h0nvo5,Expanding my B2B2C platform from Portugal to the US,"Hi guys,

I‚Äôm seeking some advice on a challenge we‚Äôre facing with our software platform. It‚Äôs a B2B2C solution that I currently sell in my home country, and from time to time, we get interest from users in other countries who really like it and propose ideas for expanding abroad.

Recently, we were approached by someone from the US who‚Äôs genuinely enthusiastic and wants to help sell our solution there. We‚Äôve agreed on terms, and while it‚Äôs exciting, we‚Äôre facing a specific challenge: currency support.

Our platform currently only supports euros, and building multicurrency functionality would require significant development work. However, our team is very small right now‚Äîwe‚Äôve had to scale back due to layoffs while extending our runway to close the next funding round.

Given these constraints, we‚Äôre considering a shortcut: creating a separate instance of the platform just for the US. This would simplify the process for now and allow us to test the waters without major investments in development.

That said, this trial comes with risks. For one, we‚Äôre not even sure if the guy will manage to sell anything. On top of that, I‚Äôm struggling to decide whether we should:
	1.	Use a different product name or domain for the US version to avoid confusion.

*  Get a full time designer - Hard to justify as we don't have enough tasks to keep the designer busy full time in the next 6 months. 
* Get a local freelancer - We tried these two times but were not very happy with the results
* Use Upwork - We are currently leaning into this one but have not heard success stories from this approach
* Get references for freelancers - While it makes sense, we are seeing that is not easy to hit the venn diagram in what we are looking for and good recommendations from peers - perhaps just need to keep asking around.

1. Which would be the most appropriate hosting company and website builder given my requirements set out below?

2. For a website selling both products and services is best practice to have a one page doom scroll website or a site with a drop down menu linked to the various sales and services offered? 

3. Where do I buy stock pictures from?

4. From experience, is is advisable to use a DIY website builder or contract in a person to develop the site?

5. Is there a central app or solution that facilitates simultaneous posting across all social media platforms or perhaps a plug in for the website?

And here are my requirements:

A. A really basic, drag/drop, copy/paste website building tool.

B. Integration of 4 site maps for customers to ""pin the tail on the donkey"" to give me a ballpark area for the service.

C. Integrated form to gather customer invoice and delivery name, address, phone number and email.

D. A way to extract this information from C above to create a database and for work sheets.

E. Facility for customers to add to shopping cart. 

F. A scheduling tool so the customer can select a date and time from a calendar and clock to book their own appointments.

G. When going to the shopping cart, I want a customer to be prompted to associated products they might add to basket.

H. A chatbot powered by AI which eventually pings me an email when it cannot answer a customer query so I can call them to resolve.

I. Link back to home page on every page, links to YouTube videos etc... embedded.

I envisage the website to have the following (rough) structure:

I'm getting ready to start designing our MVP in Figma (non-technical co-founder). I'm getting some conflicting answers as to whether we should design (in Figma) entirely from scratch (which would be free), or if it's better to go with an established library (i.e., MUI, Ant Design, etc).

If we build it from scratch, we have greater control. But that would take up a lot of time and it would push our launch way out. If we go with paying for a UI kit/library, I'm worried that it may ""look like other products"" or that ""it's not innovative enough"". I also just don't know how common paying for a library is for startups (and companies in general), and if that would impact how potential investors view us.

One advice I got was to use an established design system/library so we can focus our time on getting the product out as quickly as possible - because at the end of the data, having real users using the product is most important. Then, later on, we can put having our own customized design system in a future roadmap.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d79,1gzwa2z,Where would you go to find a technical business partner?,"Hey guys,

I'm at the point in getting my new startup off the ground that I need to find a more technical partner. I've been all over Linkedin and Upwork but haven't had any success in finding the right person yet. I'm hoping ya'll can point me in the right direction to find this person.

My business is a simple services company in which clients can hire assistants through us. We have a unique list of first clients that are keen to buy from us. I'm currently managing everything in Google sheets. I need a partner that's built a customer journey system from the ground up using simple tools, but in a way that leaves room for us to scale in the future.

Ideally, the person I'm looking for wants to build something from the ground up, is open to coming on as a full time tech lead in the future, and is in a time zone similar to the US. I'd really like to work with someone in their mid to late 20s who is ready for their chance to own something. The reason I want someone in LATAM is both financial and because that's where a large part of our business is coming from.

I tried using arcdev, and similar sites, but a lot of these sites require a business domain to make an account. I'm still operating totally out of gmail and haven't even bought a domain yet so I can't get into these sites.

Where would you go to find someone like this?

The other reason I'm having trouble is because this isn't necessarily a developer, or a designer, or a PM but someone who can do it all to start out. It seems like a lot of technical folks are really niched-out especially as they get more senior in their careers so I'm not sure what type of role to be posting int he first place.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e29,1gtytu9,87.7% of entrepreneurs struggle with at least one mental health issue,"Hey,

I was procrastinating a little bit, looking at random posts on reddit and articles on google and I came across this thing on a website called Founder Reports. Now I don't get shocked easily because I know that we have a mental health crisis going on that no one really talks about but 87,7% is just too much IMO. 

I wonder why isn't anyone talking about this? And if they are it's not enough. Imagine you sat 10 people in a room and 9 of them had a mental health problem going on. That would be quite concerning. 

The thing with us entrepreneurs is, we don't really care about anything else but success, whatever it may be. And we are willing to risk it all, even at the expense of our mental health. But what happens if you don't make it and it gets worse I ask myself? What then? Do we just ""thug"" it out? Do we tell someone? Oh, but what if they don't understand us? It's normal for entrepreneurs to try and figure things out by themselves but what If they can't? What then? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for all of us or are some destined for misery their whole life? This is a really shocking statistic and a huge problem in our circle. I'm lucky and have friends who are also entrepreneurs and we can talk about our struggles (business and mental), but many people don't.

I think the bigger issue is that we‚Äôve normalized suffering as part of the entrepreneurial journey. ""Hustle culture"" tells us to work harder, sleep less, and figure it all out on our own. But at what cost? If 87.7% of us are struggling with mental health issues, then clearly, something is broken. We‚Äôre told to be resilient, but resilience shouldn‚Äôt mean ignoring our well-being...

What‚Äôs worse is that many of us don‚Äôt have a support system in place. Like I said, some entrepreneurs are lucky enough to have friends who get it, but what about the ones who don‚Äôt? Who do they talk to when the stress becomes unbearable? And how do they even bring it up without feeling like they‚Äôre admitting failure?

I don‚Äôt have all the answers, but I think we need to talk about this more. We need safe spaces where founders can openly share their struggles without judgment. Maybe it‚Äôs an online community, a meetup, or even just a buddy system where you check in with someone who understands what you‚Äôre going through.

What do you guys think? Is there something that has helped you manage the mental toll of being an entrepreneur and running your own business? Or are you just pushing through, hoping it gets better?

I‚Äôve got some advice to share that‚Äôs been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? ‚ÄúDone is better than perfect.‚Äù Don‚Äôt get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cc7,1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing ‚Ç¨75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cdc,1h5l966,Do you create avatars for your marketing strategy?,"Creating an avatar means you imagine what your target audience is like and try to feel into them. This could look like:

* male, 30 years old
* plays golf
* reads the financial times
* is a lot on social media
* ...

I've often read and seen people using avatars for their marketing strategy. I undestand that bringing your target audience 'into live' is nice to get a better feeling of what they are like and ultimately how to get in touch with them. But from my understanding most of the characteristics is based on pure speculation and assumptions. Let's take my example with the 30 year old male. I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

I am pretty sure I miss something here, in this entire create an avatar concept.

An IT consultant friend recommended getting a NAS (a private cloud solution that works like Google Cloud but stores data on your own hard drives). I got to say, wish we'd known about this tech earlier.

When we‚Äôre on the same Wi-Fi, uploading files to the NAS is way faster than cloud. For us constantly dealing with big files (we're talking 4K videos that are several gb each), this saves a ton of time and frustration.

Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but there‚Äôs something reassuring about keeping all data on our own drive instead of a third-party server. You know what I mean... it just feels safer? 

And upgrading cloud storage every few months cus we ran out of space was getting ridiculously expensive. With the NAS, we‚Äôve cut those fees and have way more flexibility to expand storage when we need it.

Anyone else using a NAS for your team?

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d42,1h1bouc,Would a R&amp;D team be necessary?,"I have a physical product idea but this product does not exist anywhere. It is a simple food product but it is a lot more difficult to manufacture than I would've thought. In fact, I wouldn't even know how to go about manufacturing this in the first place to achieve the intended result. I have been using this product like this for over a year and I know many other people have been too so I know it works and could be a good product.



I did make a very simple version but it runs into a lot of problems that I cannot solve without redesigning the whole product. I have a list of potential solutions and design ideas that I believe solve everything and can fix these issues but I have no way to prove and see if they do which they very well may not even fix it. Which is why I am looking to either talk to a R&amp;D team or a product designer about this.



My question is, is it worth getting an R&amp;D team to try to create the product or should I simply just get a product designer to design the product and send it to the manufacturer? The issue I am having is I cannot find anyone that specializes in what I am doing specifically which is why I am considering getting a R&amp;D team.

Source Techcrunch


What‚Äôs the secret to startup success? Not the trends that so many Silicon Valley founders subscribe to, Andreessen Horowitz general partner VC Martin Casado said to a standing-room-only crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt last week. 

Before joining the storied VC firm, Casado founded two other companies, including Nicira, a networking infrastructure company he sold to VMware for $1.25 billion. When asked for advice about achieving success, he warned founders to beware of ‚Äúhustle culture‚Äù trends.

‚ÄúSilicon Valley is so performative, right? There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòdoing startups‚Äô and doing ‚Äòthe right stuff‚Äô and being part of the culture club and doing networking,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to hear about all the hustle, crazy stuff. And feel free to go ahead and think about that. But if you‚Äôre doing a startup, you should really, really focus on your mental well-being.‚Äù 

For instance, he hears a lot of founders ‚Äúfocusing on how they can be as productive as possible in a given day,‚Äù he said. They script their days: wake up at 5, eat certain foods, work out, and ‚Äúfast during so-and-so times,‚Äù he describes. 

Beyond that there are productivity hacks like ‚ÄúEat the Frog,‚Äù doing your most disliked task first thing every morning; the Pomodoro Technique, working in 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks; and countless other trends.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any of that really had a serious impact. I think the most important thing is just to do the thing,‚Äù Casado advises.

Instead of filling a day with rigidity, ‚Äústartups are so hard, and you as a founder, are so traumatized that I actually think you need to kind of do the opposite ‚Ä¶ just focus on staying sane and taking care of yourself.‚Äù 

That might mean ‚Äúsleeping in and eating fast food,‚Äù he says. Founders need to understand that it will likely take years to achieve success, and there‚Äôs no guarantee that they ever will. Lifestyle hacks that may work to hit an approaching deadline might not be sustainable as a way of life for years.

‚ÄúThings always take way longer than you expect. And I think the people that actually just focus on their well-being are the ones that survive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you can survive, at the end of the day, you‚Äôll have a shot at winning.‚Äù",345,startups,1731239890.0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gnz3iy/productivity_hacks_are_overrated_says_a16z_vc_who/,experience,"[""It's such a rollercoaster that you need to find what balances out the ride (which will be unique to you) so you can stay on it and so you can keep showing up consistently for yourself and your team."", ""Some days I'm inspired and do a lot of work.

Is someone going to ever read/need it? Someone might say, ""Oh, you will thank yourself in the future."" Well, then write it in the future when you need it. Unless a requirement of your actual goal involves things like documentation, then don\'t do it beyond what you know is super critical.\n\n* Unit/Integration tests. These will increase productivity by reducing tech debt which is a productivity killer. Tech debt can entirely kill a complex project if the tech debt causes all productivity to grind to a halt. \n\n* Use the correct tools for the problem. Often people will use the wrong tools because they only have the one tool. I have had many projects do better with a tool I learned for the project instead of a tool I long mastered. This one often goes with tech debt as the wrong tool or framework can end up being battled in the end to the point where all progress stops.\n\n* Perfection is the killer of done. \n\n* Meetings. Avoid all meetings where possible. If a meeting isn\'t ending with a decision and an actionable plan, then the meeting was a waste of time. Meetings for sharing information are all a waste of time. This is what emails are for.\n\n* Be able to prioritize. This is another productivity killer. I have had way too many projects get bogged down in minutia. For example. Let\'s say a logo changes mid-project. This logo happens to be a pain for some technical reason to change. Unless the company is some massive company with a serious branding effort, would it be worth delaying the release of a project a week to change the logo in version 1.0? This will not be one week, as there are probably 52 other similarly non-critical things which will each take a week. This isn\'t only for the developer themselves, but the people who are asking for these changes. It is a master level skill to be able to get them to fully agree that a finished product now is better than delaying for a bunch of piddling changes. A second part of this skill is to be able to kill less than critical features which are bogging the whole project down. Maybe that somewhat important but not critical reporting feature is tying the developers up in knots. Kill it for now and get the damn thing out there generating revenue. \n\nBut, if you look at most of the above, it is still just the first one; avoid distractions. Distractions aren\'t just reading reddit or meetings, they are working on frivolous tasks, features, etc which if they weren\'t done wouldn\'t remove any value.', 'Just doing the damn thing is spot on.

I can tell that you\'re in a serious situation, and it seems to me like you have what it takes to eventually succeed as an entrepreneur, so I\'ll give you advice that I think will actually help you instead of trying to spare your feelings.\n\nFirst of all, I need more information to give you any decent advice here. Entrepreneurship is a lot more complex and difficult than people talking online make it seem like, and I don\'t know where you are on your skill set as an entrepreneur. I make a lot of assumptions in this comment because of the lack of information, but even if I gloss over some critical information that only you are privy to, I hope it\'s helpful anyway.\n\n**A few things that I can gather from this post that will work against you:**\n\n1. You need motivation. (Motivation is critical for success, and you need to already have it in a consistent way. It should either come from your internal perception of your reality, or the way your environment interacts with your state of psychological reward &amp; punishment. For this reason alone, I currently believe that if you try to start a business as you are now, you will fail.\n2. You think that a landing page will get you customers. In other words, you currently know nothing about marketing, and are currently in the uniformed optimism phase of your knowledge about both marketing and entrepreneurship. ([Context for my usage of the phrase ""Uninformed optimism""](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uninformed-optimism-joe-cantanucci/)). If I assume that you will figure out a way to engineer your environment to lead you to consistent motivation, and I assume that your idea is targeting real customer pain and alleviating it, than you still need to set aside at minimum the next few months to learning marketing fundamentals.\n3. You only have until march to succeed.\n\nIt sounds like you are set on starting a business. If you had years to keep trying, failing, and learning, I believe you would eventually succeed. But having less than 4 months to legitimately go through this process is literal insanity. You would be an outlier in the world of entrepreneurship if you were able to succeed that quickly.\n\n**A few things I can gather that will work for you:**\n\n1. You have a deadline. This could potentially become an internal motivator for you to succeed.\n2. Since you already have a specific niche in mind, you might already be on the right track. The hardest part when you\'re getting started is finding a real problem to solve/making sure the customers you\'re helping are actually in pain. Without that, they probably won\'t pay you.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI don\'t know much about how visas and deportation work, so I can\'t comment much on that. Just be careful since if you don\'t make money with your business before march, and you start applying to jobs too late, you could find yourself in the worst possible situation.\n\nUltimately, I think you should apply to every job you can right now and focus all of your attention on securing your visa right now. Once you have one, you can start saving cash for your future venture, while figuring out ways to secure your visa longer.\n\nI understand the desire to do what you\'re uniquely qualified to do better than probably anyone you\'ve talked to before, because it\'s been a major theme in my life. So I understand how hard it probably is for you to accept my previous statement. But I say it anyway because **you absolutely must avoid making gambles where the outcome is unacceptable if you lose**. If you take enough of those gambles in your lifetime, you will eventually lose everything. No matter how competent or successful you are or become.\n\nWhen you make a post like this in the future, I recommend including more details. I can only respond to the information you\'ve given me in this post, so any information you\'ve left out is context I can not respond to.\n\n**Example information you should include:**\n\n\\- What is currently motivating you  \n\\- Your expertise  \n\\- Industry experience  \n\\- Your economic situation  \n\\- Your age  \n\\- Your ICP  \n\\- Your approach on reaching PMF  \n\\- What you\'ve tried that\'s failed in the past and why you believe it\'s failed  \n\\- What you\'ve tried that\'s succeeded in the past and why you believe it succeeded.  \n\\- Why you think your current project may fail or succeed.\n\nI really wish you the best. But I\'m sorry. I don\'t believe entrepreneurship is a real option for you right now.']"

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d3d,1h1itum,"Would you use a platform where you can pitch ideas, fund apps, and share in the success?","Hey Reddit,

I‚Äôve been working on a new platform idea that connects people who have creative app ideas with developers who can bring those ideas to life. The twist? It‚Äôs not just about funding‚Äîit‚Äôs about **collaboration, trust, and sharing success**.

  
I have completed the core functionality development.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

* **Got an idea?** Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve always wanted an app for something specific. You can post your idea on the platform, and developers can pick it up if they think it‚Äôs feasible (and worth doing). If the community likes your idea, they can even invest in it, giving the developer the funds they need to make it happen.
* **For developers:** Developers can see which ideas have the most interest or funding **before starting work**, so they don‚Äôt waste time building something nobody wants. Plus, they can get funding upfront to help with the development process.
* **Revenue sharing:** When the app is launched, people who invested early can share in the revenue it generates. This gives everyone an incentive to support great ideas and help them succeed.
* **Credit and trust:** One of the key features I‚Äôm working on is a **credit rating system** for developers. Their ‚Äúscore‚Äù is based on their track record‚Äîapps they‚Äôve completed, user satisfaction, and how well they‚Äôve met deadlines. Over time, as the platform grows, this credit system will expand to include investors and idea contributors, so trust becomes a key part of the ecosystem.

I‚Äôve already built the core of this platform, and a few developers are excited to join. They see it as a way to avoid the usual guesswork (or funding struggle) that comes with indie development.

Here‚Äôs where I need your input:

1. **Would you use a platform like this?** Maybe you have a cool idea you‚Äôd love to see made, or maybe you‚Äôd want to invest in apps you think could succeed.
2. **As a developer, does this sound like something you‚Äôd find helpful?** Would you be okay sharing revenue if it meant upfront funding and validation for your project?
3. **What would make this platform trustworthy?** (I know trust is a big deal when it comes to money and ideas.)

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any questions! I‚Äôm trying to make sure this solves real problems for both developers and users before I go all in.

How do people just get on with it without doubting whether this wording is the most compelling, or the website design doesn't look clunky, or I'm not getting to the right people?

The sales and marketing world is so much harder than coding, and at the same time much more squishy and ill defined :-)

The first acquisition offer was like 3-4 years in and was for like $750k. I didn't take it as I thought the company was worth more.

The next acquisition offer was like 8 years in.  It was for like $4M but then when I went in for the very last meeting they wanted to low ball me at like $840k or something.

Honestly, I thought the whole thing was shady so I just walked out.

The last one I actually approached one of our major customers and asked them to acquire us - which they eventually ended up doing for 7 figures.

Here's the thing though, for smaller companies, is that the best strategy?

I think maybe the BEST way to go (to maximize value) would be to just focus on growth, then wait until a BUYER approaches.  

The problem is that some of my ideas, I think I might want to build, get to like $500k in ARR, then flip them.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f58,1gki7q1,Mini dilemma I need advice on! Please help,"I'm a university CS student and I thought of this new ERP system to integrate into businesses within this specific industry, because it was very outdated and not regulated enough in a sense.

However, recently a local startup raised $1mn+ in a seed round to create this exact system I thought of, and essentially solves the same problem with most of the ""cherry on top"" features I imagined.

I connected with the Founder &amp; CEO of the company on linkedin, and we exchanged a few messages - more so how I was interested in the company etc. and he gave me some HR person's email for future reference.

Cool.

However, (maybe this is me being stubborn now) I honestly believe the vision their product is going in is not the right direction at all, especially if aiming for global expansion. Think of their app as more fruity, colourful, very consumer B2C looking despite it being a B2B - and my vision being more professional, enterprise focused and ""sleek"". I know multiple people in the industry who wouldn't let their ego suffice to a consumer looking product, because at this level sure it may be more productive for businesses to use the product, but if it doesn't entice them from first glance why would they use it if it won't bring major earnings growth etc (which this product won't directly - it's more of an efficiency boost).

My question now is this, do I either:

a) Build my own platform, following the vision that I intend on (a lot of UI and cultural changes rather than technical feature changes)

or

b) Join the company, but work as a part-time/full-time (idk) sales associate? I'm very confident in the fact I could sell this system to the right people and expand the company, but I don't support the vision of the product 100%

I\'m not sure you\'re really making a great case for why your vision would be so much better/different.

But that would probably need to extend beyond UI design, as that\'s easy for any competitor to change.\n\n3.) One of the challenges for ERPs - as a startup - is that your incumbent competitors have a very well established product with many, many features. It can take years of developer hours to build a new ERP that gets to feature parity. And the *minimum* bar for customers to switch will be feature parity.

If you can get a software-engineering job with these guys and it\'s an industry you are interested in, then great! Take a job. You might have opinions about what this software should be, but they are the one\'s who formed a team, got funding and are executing. So learn what you can.\n\nIf you don\'t need/want a job, then sure, why not build this thing as a side-project that you might be able to monetise or grow into a full-blown startup. I will repeat my #1 caution: do NOT fall into the ""I\'ve spent 3+ years working on this idea for every spare second and I\'m only 6 months away from finishing and I\'m totally exhausted and I hate coding and now how do I get a customer?"" trap. That would be the worst possible way to spend your time at this stage of your career.']"

Idea Concept: A Question-Answer Based Friendship Platform Using Short Videos In online communities, people often have different opinions, and voting is a common way to express preferences. But what if voting could be more like a friendship test? People have diverse thoughts, but what if we could use short videos, similar to TikTok, to make friends by finding the right questions? The concept involves an algorithm that matches people based on shared interests and questions. If you don‚Äôt like a question, you can swipe it away just like on TikTok. Anyone can ask or answer questions, and the questions can be in the form of short videos, images, or text. The key is to find people whose answers match the question by 70-90%. This matching process ensures that the users have common interests and can connect deeply. The goal is to create a space where people can find like-minded individuals, which, in turn, fosters meaningful interactions. Through video, text, and image content, users can answer questions and swipe through others‚Äô inquiries, leading to a dynamic exchange of ideas. Since anyone can ask questions or provide answers, the platform encourages a continuous flow of engagement and the discovery of new perspectives. If the algorithm finds that you have similar answers to someone, you are likely to have aligned interests, creating an organic environment for meaningful friendships.

Over the years, I‚Äôve seen how moving R&amp;D work to Mexico has helped many businesses grow. One of our clients just won 2nd place in a BOT competition in Florida, and it feels amazing to be part of their success. We hope to help more companies achieve this.

The new tax rules in the U.S. (like Section 174) make things harder for startups. You now have to pay taxes on money that was spent on engineers, even if you don‚Äôt have profits yet. That‚Äôs unfair for people trying to build something new.

I know some people might worry about outsourcing, especially when it comes to protecting intellectual property (IP). I used to feel the same, especially when I worked with teams in other countries. I worried if contracts and NDAs would actually protect my work. I think it‚Äôs a cultural thing too. But I‚Äôve learned that with good agreements and clear communication, it‚Äôs possible to overcome these concerns.

For anyone struggling with these changes, there are solutions. Mexico is a great option for R&amp;D. It has talented professionals, affordable costs, and is close to the U.S. You can focus on creating and stop worrying about taxes or rules that don‚Äôt make sense.

They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting**¬†after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.**¬†Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation? How did you figure out if it was time to seek validation in more dynamic markets? I need to connect with those who've been through this.

This is a quick story of how I sold a failed project on acquire in my first 2 weeks of university 

So i made an SEO based SaaS tool that basically when you give it a website it automatically writes content that outranks that specific websites 
The problem was that i was afraid of continuing the SaaS because i got some backlash.

The nail in the coffin was when someone marked one of the websites stripe transaction as fraudulent, disputed it by accident and i almost got my stripe account suspended but i contacted the guy and everything was fine.

So i stupidly cancelled all the subscription i had, around 250$ mrr worth of it and decided to shut down the project. After i week i cracked my macbooks screen with a screwdriver driver (don‚Äôt ask how) and got a quote for 750$ :)) from apple. 
I had no money saved so i got the brilliant idea to sell some old products. Listed the app on acquire, got denied buti dmed the guy that runs it and got it listed. Acquire is a great app but escrow.com is a terrible service. In 2 days i found a buyer did all the processes and it took escrow 7 days to finish/delay the hole process‚Ä¶ and i got my money on the 9th working day. Yeah terrible service and support.

Sold the app and repaired the mac! Which is awesome.

Now i am on the next thing, programmatic seo for SaaS websites that use either framer or webflow.

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm reaching out for advice on what to do in my current situation. First, a little about me: I‚Äôm an Argentinian entrepreneur who studied at the University of Georgia. My time there was the best experience of my life, and I made some amazing friends. One of those friends and I always talked about starting a business importing vehicle parts and agricultural machinery to Argentina.

For different reasons (like the pandemic), we couldn‚Äôt move forward at the time, but about a year ago, we finally started working on this project seriously. On my side, I managed to get everything ready: I hired trade specialists, customs brokers, and sales agents, and I even had several potential orders lined up.

Unfortunately, just a few days ago, my friend told me he got a great job offer in another state and won‚Äôt be able to continue with the business. I‚Äôm happy for him, but this has left me in a tough spot. I invested all my savings into this, got my visa, bought flights, reserved an apartment and car‚Äîall for February, when I planned to visit the US to get things started. Now, I feel like I have nothing left.

This is where I could really use your advice.

Should I just cut my losses, cancel the trip, and move on?
If you think I should continue, what are some places, conventions, or events where I could meet entrepreneurs interested in selling their products in Argentina (or even importing from here)?
I‚Äôm open to any suggestions. I don‚Äôt care if I have to go to Atlanta, Alaska, or any other place‚Äîif it means making just one solid contact to keep moving forward, I‚Äôm ready to do whatever it takes. I just don‚Äôt want to give up after coming this far and involving so many people on this side of the project.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

**How You Can Help**

I have an investor who want to invest in my startup based in the UK.   
We discussed 2x different involvement which will require 2x different contract: 1x for the investment and 1x for a advisor position.  
  
I would like to know what are the next steps regarding contracts and shares.

I believe for the investment, I need to :   
\- Make him sign a Shareholder application letter for new shares  
\- Set a board meeting to approve this (It's only me so it's easy)  
\- Send him the approval letter  
\- He send the money  
\- I fill and send a SH01 Form to companies house  
\- That's it

Is that correct?

For the advisory contract, I bellieve I need to :   
\- Create a contract with cliff/vesting as we discussed  
\- We both sign the document  
\- Once shares vest, issue shares by fillling a SH01 to companies house.

You do those things then you\'re ahead of 50% of startups right off the bat, even the ones with a full in-house development team who didn\'t bother to find out if anyone wanted their product in the first place.   Being preoccupied with scalability in a small boostrapped venture is putting the cart \\*way\\* before the horse.\n\nFinding a technical co-founder is obviously the ideal scenario but you have no idea when the right co-founder fit is going to present itself, and rushing to bring on a co-founder simply to develop your platform is a horror story waiting to happen.

We don't have access to the information you'd need to answer your questions."", 'TL;DR; you\'re not getting any amount of money that would be considered life changing. Use the things you\'ve learned from this experience to keep climbing in your career and become a founder/exec yourself to get access to the real money.\n\n10,000,000 outstanding shares is a typical number to issue during the initial formation of a Delaware C corp. Institutional investors insist on converting any company into a Delaware C corp before investing since corporate law in Delaware is standardized and well understood. The number of outstanding shares can be wildly more (but unlikely to be less) depending on the age of the startup and the amount of funding taken on. For example, Reddit had something like 187,000,000 shares outstanding pre-IPO.\n\nThe employee stock option pool (which is where your shares came from) is typically anywhere from 10% to 20% of the total shares, so 1,000,000 to 2,000,000. Investors make you increase this every funding round to give them confidence that you\'ll retain top talent.\n\nPart of the shares are set aside to secure high-demand execs or consultants (maybe 10%), and the rest is split between the founders of the startup. C-level founder splits can look like 40% for the CEO, 20% for the CTO, 10% for the COO, etc. The CEO is the person held most liable for the success of the company and is first in line for legal action if something goes sideways, so they always get the majority of equity and it\'s important to understand why this is necessary and okay.\n\nAll of the shares I mentioned before are referred to as ""common stock"". Investors dilute everyone (common stock holders) when they put money into a company. A startup might have taken on as much as 80% dilution by the time a liquidation event (like the one you mentioned) occurs. The percentage of dilution is higher for consumer technology or hard-tech startups and lower for B2B SaaS startups since those generate more revenue in the early days.\n\nLet\'s assume a roughly p90 outcome for startup acquisitions and that your startup is being acquired for $100 million by a Fortune 500 company.\n\n$100,000,000 purchase price of startup \\* 0.20 remaining value of common stock after dilution (assuming 80% dilution) = $20,000,000 million that goes to common stock holders\n\nAssuming a standard 10,000,000 shares issued at the formation of the startup and 80% dilution, and considering that you were given 23,000 shares from the ESOP, your full potential equity value would be (23,000 / 10,000,000) \\* $20,000,000 = $46,000.\n\n$46,000, fully vested.\n\nThat\'s a typical outcome for an employee of a startup. This number only goes down if the startup has issued additional shares. It can go up if the acquiring company is paying $200 or $300 million, but that\'s only 2x or 3x your equity.\n\nHopefully you\'ve noticed how that company was built so that you can get a much bigger piece of the pie by either becoming a founder yourself or being a founding engineer or exec. You could also consult for a high ticket price.\n\nFor reference, in that hypothetical scenario with the founder split I mentioned, the COO would make $2 million, the CTO would make $4 million, and the CEO would make $8 million. That\'s enough money to potentially retire on fixed-income from real estate if they qualify for QSBS, meaning they wouldn\'t pay any taxes on the money they earn from the sale of the startup if they\'ve held their options for more than 5 years and the assets of the startup did not exceed $50 million when they were granted their stock options. This sounds really unfair, but consider that many startups (and therefore jobs and career opportunities) might not exist if this incentive did not exist.']"
67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d6c,1h0bbbq,Having low lead conversions ? Sharing what worked for me. ,"In my previous job, I was working as product head. We faced a frustrating challenge‚Äîlow lead conversions. The sales team worked hard, but the results just weren‚Äôt there. Blame was coming on me in a way that product is not good.  I started digging deeper by taking multiple calls myself and found the core issues that were holding us back:

First, **the sales team didn‚Äôt truly understand the product.** If they didn‚Äôt know the ins and outs of what made it better than competitors, how could they convince anyone else?

Second, **they weren‚Äôt listening to customers.** Instead of focusing on what the customer needed, they were too focused on pitching the product. This led to missed opportunities to connect with potential buyers.

We also realized that **urgency was missing.** Customers had no reason to act right away. Without creating a sense of ‚Äúwhy now,‚Äù decisions were pushed aside.

Here‚Äôs what worked:

* Help your team deeply understand the product‚Äîwhat it does, why it‚Äôs special, and how it solves problems.
* Shift the focus to the customer‚Äôs needs and challenges.
* Show why now is the best time to act‚Äîdon‚Äôt leave urgency out of the equation.

When we put these into practice, conversions improved, and sales took off.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37ca2,1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this.

So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for!

Developers are problem-solvers, not fortune-tellers. They need to see evidence that your idea addresses a real market need, has traction, or is backed by a clear execution plan. 

Unrealistic expectations, vague pitches, or equity-heavy offers without upfront commitment can make them hesitant. Want to win them over? Validate your concept, respect their expertise, and show you‚Äôre just as invested in the journey as they are.

Here is the framework I use:

1. Low-cost prototype creation ($100-$500)

* Clickable UI mockups
* Core user flows
* Basic branding



1. Customer validation sprint (2-3 weeks)

* 20+ user interviews
* Market sizing
* Competitor analysis
* Revenue projections



1. Find technical co-founder with proof

* Validated prototype
* User feedback data
* Revenue model
* Clear technical scope



# Equity Recommendation

* If you‚Äôve done the work listed (prototyping, validation, and planning), consider negotiating **35-45% equity** for the technical co-founder rather than 50%.

* However, 50% may still be fair if:
   * The product is highly complex and demands extensive development.
   * The technical co-founder is also taking on operational or strategic roles.
   * The project requires significant long-term technical investment.

  
Equity decisions should ultimately reflect the value of each person‚Äôs contributions and align incentives for the company‚Äôs success.

This only makes sense to them as your half might be worth millions, way the heck more than hiring a handful of programmers,\n\nSo, as a tech person why would you take 50/50 when you could spend the same resources building a product of your own. Or pair up with another tech person(s) with the same dream and figure out the business stuff yourselves. When you have a viable product it is not hard to find a salesperson who you pay a commission, not equity to.

Your prospective developer wants to be able to pay rent/mortage and buy groceries and internet access.\n\n2) A proposal/idea which is already technically developed enough so that a technical engineer will look at it and go ""Hey, this might actually be genuinely feasible in the real world, and also really technically interesting to work on."" This means that unless you get REALLY lucky, you will need to have enough technical know-how to be able to both evaluate your idea and present it accordingly.

Someone who has little industry experience but wants to build something \'cool\'. Just enough tech skill to be able to construct a barely-functional prototype, which you can hopefully start selling for enough money to hire some better developers for v2.0. It\'s a trade-off; you\'re not going to get the fastest results, or the best prototype, or be able to pivot as quickly, or solve as many technical issues that arise, but they\'re more likely to work for little money upfront (potentially even just equity) or walk away on the spot when the cash runs out.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37da8,1gxt3l8,Seeking Advice: Should I Start a Consulting Side Hustle to Fund My Entrepreneurial Goals?,"Hi Reddit, I‚Äôd love your advice on this.

Background: I‚Äôm 25 and currently work in a mid-range management consulting firm (not top-tier ones like McKinsey). Back in 2019, during my second year of college, I started a startup that gained a lot of positive attention. We even pitched it to our state CM, who was impressed. Things were going well, especially during COVID when the team and I could work extensively from home. Our efforts yielded good results.

However, in my final year of college, I had to prioritize getting a job through campus placements because my parents weren‚Äôt supportive financially. My father is toxic and abusive, and I needed stability. While my co-founders wanted to go all-in on the startup, I couldn‚Äôt join them due to a lack of capital and parental support. They eventually left the startup but still hold shares. The company is still running (minimal revenue), but I‚Äôm funding it myself to keep it afloat.

Now, I‚Äôve moved out of my parents‚Äô house but still can‚Äôt quit my job since my father is retiring, and as the eldest child, I need to help my family financially. Despite this, I can‚Äôt shake off my entrepreneurial spirit.

Question:
I‚Äôve been mentoring kids through Nasscom Foundation and helping friends with their ventures, and I‚Äôve found a deep passion for it. The work aligns with my consulting job, and I‚Äôve become good at problem-solving and structuring strategies. For instance, I was paid well for a two-month part-time consulting gig with Nasscom.

Recently, I helped a friend, and they suggested I start a side hustle offering consulting services. This idea resonates with me because it could create a side income to help me eventually leave my job and fully pursue my venture. My main interest lies in tech for good.

Would you recommend pursuing this as a side hustle? If so, how should I go about finding and reaching out to clients? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",2,startups,1732342347.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gxt3l8/seeking_advice_should_i_start_a_consulting_side/,question,"[""It sounds like you're in a tough but exciting position ‚Äî balancing the stability of your job with the entrepreneurial drive that‚Äôs always been there. From what you‚Äôve shared, it seems like consulting could be a great side hustle for you, especially given your expertise and passion for mentoring and problem-solving.\n\nFirst, it‚Äôs smart to start small while keeping your day job, especially since you're supporting your family and still managing your startup. A side hustle in consulting allows you to gradually build a client base and test the waters without taking on too much risk. Plus, since you‚Äôre already working in consulting and mentoring, you likely have a network that can refer you to potential clients, or at least point you in the right direction.\n\nHere‚Äôs some advice for getting started:\n\n1. **Leverage Your Network**: Since you've been mentoring and working with others, start by offering your services to people within your network. You might already have people who trust you and could be interested in working with you.\n2. **Define Your Niche**: Since you‚Äôre passionate about ‚Äútech for good,‚Äù that could be your unique selling proposition. Focus on solving problems for startups, nonprofits, or other organizations working in the tech-for-good space. Having a clear focus will help attract the right clients.\n3. **Start with Small Projects**: Offering affordable, smaller-scale consulting services to begin with allows you to build your portfolio, refine your approach, and gain testimonials that will be valuable when you decide to scale up.\n4. **Build an Online Presence**: Start a website, blog, or LinkedIn profile that highlights your experience, past projects, and areas of expertise. This will make it easier for potential clients to find you.\n5. **Set Boundaries**: It‚Äôs important to balance your side hustle with your current job, so set clear boundaries about how much time you can dedicate to consulting without burning out. Be transparent with clients about your availability.\n\nLastly, you might also want to consider connecting with entrepreneurial communities and attending events or networking meetups to meet potential clients. Offering free or discounted advice or workshops to organizations or groups aligned with your passions could be a great way to get started.\n\nGood luck, and it‚Äôs inspiring to see your dedication to both your family and your entrepreneurial spirit! Keep pushing forward, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find success in both consulting and eventually launching your full-time venture."", 'We did IT development / consulting for other startups while we were looking for the ""next idea"".

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37f8a,1gixegh,Identifying Pain Points: Why Are My Interviews So Vague? (Initial pain discovery stage),"Hi there,

I am in the process of identifying a pain point to solve. I have read multiple books, such as ‚ÄúStart Form Zero‚Äù by Dane Maxwell, ‚ÄúThe Mom Test‚Äù by Rob Fitzpatrick and others similar.

I understand that I should start broad: Not focusing on my skill set or the profession/industry I have experience in, which will allow me to identify issues, I would have not expected before.

Makes sense. So I messaged a lot of people, to ask to interview them. I got two responses which resulted in one interview till now. It went semi-well. I had the feeling the interviewee was not sure what to talk about. The second response was, ‚ÄúThe email is a bit generic in terms of the problem. Is there anything in particular you are looking for?‚Äù. The third response I got was at a meetup from different people at a panel talk. Where the replies were very broad, like my question:

What‚Äôs the biggest challenge you‚Äôve faced in your professional day-to-day in the last weeks?

So what should I do then? When they name one problem such as ‚ÄúAmerican investors moving into Europe‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPeople management issues where job objectives have been documented, and signed but came as a surprise in the end.‚Äù?

1. Ask for more pains, till I find one that seems interesting and worthy of pursuing?
2. Ask straight away for multiple?
3. Just go ahead with that particular one, so they don‚Äôt make up others?
4. Something else?

Living in a small city away from interesting events/meetings, I feel like it‚Äôs not easy to just rock up to an event and casually talk to people. So I feel stuck and don‚Äôt want to waste people‚Äôs time. What are your thoughts on this? Is this normal?",9,startups,1730668362.0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gixegh/identifying_pain_points_why_are_my_interviews_so/,question,"['&gt;&gt; I understand that I should start broad\n\nWhat kind of terrible advice have you been fed?\n\nLook around at the big successes like Google or Facebook or Nvidia.

I worked for a wildly, wildly successful startup in the outdoorsman space, started by a guy who is wholly non-technical. Why? He really likes hunting.

My partner and I hold equal equity in our venture. About a month ago, while attempting to raise $200,000 at $2m valuation we faced numerous rejections.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e79,1grgl4i,"Launched 3 Hours Ago and Already Got 2,641 Signups for Our SaaS Product (That Isn‚Äôt Even Out Yet!)","Hi everyone,

After months of intense work, our team finally launched the waitlist for our AI-powered no-code SaaS product. The goal? To create something truly competitive and unique in the market. It‚Äôs been a whirlwind of design, development, and perfecting every detail to bring something fresh and impactful. Here‚Äôs the story of how we got to 2,641 signups in just three hours!

**The Journey: Months of Prep**  
  
We‚Äôve spent countless hours developing an MVP that would genuinely bring a competitive edge. The plan was to release it officially later this week, but we wanted to get an early pool of excited adopters on board. So, we decided to launch a simple landing page with a waitlist‚Äîjust something to build some initial interest from the right people.

But to make sure our product grabbed attention, we needed something that would show its value *fast*. That‚Äôs where our 29-second video demo came in - showcasing our main value proposition.

**The Key Move: A super-short, 29-Second Video Demo**  
  
To convey how easy and powerful our product is, we put together a super short, 29-second video showing off the happy path of using it.

Every second was crafted carefully, we obsessed over every frame in Adobe Premiere Pro, making sure it perfectly demonstrated how our solution simplifies things compared to existing options. Our goal was to show, not tell.

With the landing page and the video demo ready, we finally launched our waitlist three hours ago.

**The Unexpected Surge: 2,641 Signups in 3 Hours**  
After publishing a few posts across relevant subreddits, we saw some nice engagement, and then‚Ä¶ it took off. A few posts started gaining serious traction.

Now, just three hours after going live, **we have 2,641 signups**, and our Slack channel is flooded with notifications of new subscribers. We weren‚Äôt expecting this kind of response, and it‚Äôs amazing to see people are genuinely interested in what we‚Äôre building‚Äîeven before the full launch.  
  
**Why We Think It Worked**

* **Focus on the core value:** Instead of listing features, we showed exactly how our product solves a real pain point
* **Short but powerful demo:** 29 seconds was just enough to showcase the magic without losing attention
* **Right timing:** We hit the sweet spot between validation and launch, creating urgency

  
**What's next...?**  
  
As excited as we are, we know the signups will eventually slow down. The obvious next step is to launch the product itself and get our users happy (which we will - number one goal!). But I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdoes anyone here have any advice for keeping the excitement going even after these initial posts lose visibility?

I‚Äôm thinking of ways to extend the momentum, maybe with some creative strategies or ideas to keep the buzz alive until the product officially launches.

I‚Äôd love to hear what would you do next?",0,startups,1731621803.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1grgl4i/launched_3_hours_ago_and_already_got_2641_signups/,experience,"['Don‚Äôt have any advice for you, just wanted to say congratulations and I hope this is the beginning of something amazing for you.

It's actually a hard tech problem to solve, needing multi-discipline skilled people (aerodynamics, mechanical, electrical, batteries, radio, operating systems with graphics, real time embedded, estimators and controllers, sensors, camera pipelines, route planning etc etc). This means it attracts people who want to solve the tech problem, and then they get so carried away with the tech problem of their domain specialty that they a) forget about the other domains that are still wildly suboptimal and b) completely forget about making a solution that customers actually want.\n\n\n2. Lots of academics. For them, getting something that worked once for a demo or to write a paper is good enough. This however isn't good enough for industrial purposes.\n\n\n3. Solution looking for a problem. So many things people suggest using drones for would be better served with either a camera on a long stick, or with a guy on an ebike. Drones as they are now still need the same numbers of pilots as a helicopter and the same charging infra an ebike needs.

I have also though about this a lot, i think there's many factors to it. \n\n  \ni think the hype arounds drones like drone deliveries etc were quite futuristic.

For deliveries as such things like battery life (there was no technology that would have made it the required long journers possible), changing weather conditions (we cant have business that only works when its nice and not windy), the tech is still young and theres a huge problems with colliding birds, other drones, buildings, treets whatever. \n\nthen the obvious which is incredibly high cost and poor roi. the iniital development cost is high, needed infra is immensely expensive and the market is kind of niche and limited. its also very hard for start ups to compete with google or amazon who can afford to build the infra and development costs. \n\npeople are also still very suspicious on drones and don't trust them. most are also concerned that they can be hacked. overall the market potential was wildly over estimated while the practical applications of drones were really limited.

I am a developer myself, and built most of the foundational system we want to commercialise. However, I'm increasingly realising that I need to spend most of my time in a technical pre-sales role, whilst also ensuring the product is built and runs smoothly.

We're currently post-POC, pre-MVP with build costs coming out of consulting fees in the interim, but the intent is a more SaaS-ified model in the future.

Given limited resources but also a requirement for me to do less development, I'm thinking about what I can do to ensure:

\- Tasks sent to off-shore developers are communicated as simply as possible (ideally, with passed unit tests being a key requirement.

\- Documentation is available and updated. I think the best way to structure this is by architectural component? We currently have API, Front-End, and an event-driven worker backend.

\- Code is properly reviewed during PR and developers are clear on the requirements

I am currently using Notion primarily, but I am increasingly thinking about what automation I can have to further reduce the burden on myself. Projects like n8n seem ideal, but the technology is just **not quite** there when it comes to a pipeline like:

\- PR is made, AI categorises the change

\- Relevant documentation pulled from Notion

\- Code audited by LLM, key changes identified

\- New documentation written by LLM and submitted for approval as a PR task

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cbb,1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It‚Äôs been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here‚Äôs what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it.¬†

Bad: You‚Äôre critiquing humans, basically, so that‚Äôs tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends ‚ÄúI needed online dating help so I paid for it‚Äù? No customer retention because they‚Äôd get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site‚Äôs marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We‚Äôd review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out.¬†

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we‚Äôd have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it‚Äôs income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn‚Äôt make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I‚Äôm a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about.¬†

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect.¬†

It died because: I didn‚Äôt pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn‚Äôt know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don‚Äôt refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to ‚Äúbuild a better mouse trap.‚Äù

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools.¬†

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating.¬†

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself.¬†

Bad: User acquisition wasn‚Äôt easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn‚Äôt pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500.¬†

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property.¬†

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don‚Äôt assume a company‚Äôs internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn‚Äôt jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales.¬†

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted‚Ä¶

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like ‚ÄúVacord Industries, LLC.‚Äù and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just ‚ÄúVacord‚Äù so the emails can be more like ‚ÄúHey Jack, how‚Äôs your xyz at Vacord?‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúHey Jack, how‚Äôs xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?‚Äù

Good: People said they‚Äôd pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out.¬†

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:¬† There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again‚Ä¶

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It‚Äôs easier to market than anything else has been, and it‚Äôs got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really glad we found your tool‚Äù is huge to me.¬†

Bad: It‚Äôs a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it‚Äôs growing slowly. I‚Äôm starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don‚Äôt be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you‚Äôre wasting your time and money building something that won‚Äôt work in the market.

\----

This isn‚Äôt even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37eb0,1gpp7cp,How do co-founders establish ownership in early stages?,"Hey all,

My co-founder and I have been working on a product for the past several months and have our first edition coming in December. I was told to not worry about ownership until it was absolutely necessary and that legally we are already joint owners by default. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been going with so far. 

However, it recently dawned on me that we will soon need a way to accept payments which to me means we need a business bank account which means we need to establish a business entity to make that account and therefore we have to establish the terms of our partnership.

That where I‚Äôm at right now and I have two questions: 

1. I already have a business bank account for a personal LLC of mine, would that be adequate to accept payments? Only issue is then I technically own all of the income since my partner is not on it.

2. If it is time to establish a shared business entity, how do you outline the terms of that? Obviously we want to protect each other in the event that someone wants to (or ought to) leave, but we wouldn‚Äôt want that individual walking away with half the business in their pocket. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm exploring the topic of founder vesting, but are there other options? 

We have a lot of trust in our relationship so potentially I could do everything through my personal LLC and eventually when we have the means to get lawyers and make a real contract I would just sign over the assets of my personal LLC to where it rightfully belongs in our joint venture. Maybe that‚Äôs something we should put in writing for the meantime. It‚Äôs hard to think that we should do all of this legal stuff before our first sale but I‚Äôd like to keep the mode of payment professional for the sake of the customer.

So I am currently in the process of validating an Enterprise tool that I am excited about. It is in the very early stage of build out, but I wanted to be very level headed and do as much customer interview as possible before proceeding with this idea. I am targeting 50 companies across small, mid-cap and large-cap companies. It is not a sales-pitch, but more of discovery call so it should make it easier for people to talk to me.  
  
The problem is with my current outreach strategy i have I am nowhere near my target size of companies to interview. Primarily have been using linkedin but my conversation rate is terrible so far. Now I am starting to optimize the messaging(adding personalization and what not) and seeing what works and what doesn't.

* What if I don‚Äôt get enough drivers to meet ride demand?
* What if there aren‚Äôt enough passengers for the number of drivers?
* I consider myself creative, but what if my marketing efforts don‚Äôt resonate and nobody starts using the app?
* Lastly, since I‚Äôll probably need an investor: What if I spend money on marketing and other essential resources, and the business ultimately fails?

I'm worried about the money too, what i'm going to pay the drivers, keep for the company, take from the passengers.

I'm about to close a pre-seed funding round with a VC based in Singapore.

I have a few questions and would appreciate any advice:

1) Should I use a U.S. SAFE (since we're a Delaware C-Corp) or consider a Singapore SAFE given the VC's location?

2) Are there any legal or tax implications I should be aware of when receiving funding from a non-U.S. VC?

Someone needs to be in charge of the development effort. Not in charge of the *product*, but in charge of *building the product.* The lead developer, who is both responsible for technical/implementation directions, and who can reliably advise the product owner as to recommendations for feature implementation (why or why not to work on specific features given development cost, possible future implications/downsides of pursuing one idea vs another from a technical-implementation standpoint, etc). \n\nIf you‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúmaybe we need a lead developer‚Äù then you *definitely need a lead developer.* Don‚Äôt make the very common mistake of thinking that ‚Äújunior devs‚Äù are going to be able to come in and guide the development effort. Junior devs don‚Äôt have the experience to do that with wisdom, and the single worst thing you can do right now is to turn your development over to a couple people who are going to turn it into a spit-and-baling-wire mess where your MVP gets interest/adoption and you are unable to scale a bug-free, reliable extension that delights customers. \n\nThe way you avoid that is having a technical developer who knows what they‚Äôre doing in charge. Someone you trust to advise and guide, not just to ‚Äúwrite code.‚Äù\n\nSo again: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs in charge?‚Äù', 'Hire at least one lead', 'You need someone to take full responsibility for the code. In general, when you hire a junior, it is so that they can work on individual, small parts of the codebase to fix simple issues, or implement simple features, but you do not expect juniors to deliver everything from start to finish, relying on them to implement security measures, best practices, well tested and maintainable code of the entire codebase.', 'Your first tech hire is important and it should absolutely be a senior developer.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c87,1h8g50t,I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer,"Had a beer with a buddy of mine the other day‚Äîhe‚Äôs a CRO at a 130-person tech startup. Out of nowhere, he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúMan, I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer.‚Äù Not gonna lie, I laughed at first, but then I realized he was dead serious.

So I ask him what‚Äôs up, and he just starts venting. He said the hardest part is he feels like he‚Äôs supposed to know everything that‚Äôs happening in the company, but it‚Äôs impossible. Marketing‚Äôs doing one thing, sales is doing another, and customer success is in their own little world. And somehow, he‚Äôs supposed to connect all the dots and make the revenue grow?

Then he talks about how he has all these big plans‚Äîlike where they need to be in 6 months, how they should be scaling, all that good stuff. But when it comes to actually putting those plans into action, it‚Äôs a mess. Teams don‚Äôt align, priorities clash, and stuff just doesn‚Äôt get done. He said it feels like no matter how much effort he puts in, something‚Äôs always slipping through the cracks.

His exact words: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it‚Äôs lost deals and missed opportunities. And I‚Äôm the only one holding the hammer.‚Äù

Honestly, it sounded rough, and it got me wondering‚Äîdo other CROs feel this way too?

If you‚Äôre a CRO (or close to one), what‚Äôs the hardest part of your job? Is it the lack of visibility, the struggle to get stuff done, or something else? 

Would love to hear how you deal with it.

People can\'t ""buy"" what they don\'t understand, so it may take a few versions to get full buy-in.\n\nOften, specialists will see their role as vital, and they will discount the contributions of other areas because they don\'t have visibility. So you want to ensure people have upstream and downstream visibility to how they efforts impact people around them and the bottom line.\n\nIt\'s possible these three groups are frustrated and that is making them entrenched.

WAY too many people try to cover the sins of failing product market fit with the gasoline of marketing spend. But there is some break even line where ___ amount of spend to get ___ amount of deals = bullshit and they should chop off that product and focus on the stuff that pays the bills. No sacred cows.\n\nThe salespeople should be easy to motivate and should ""pay"" not ""cost"" in the sense that they kill more than they eat. If that is backwards, they either have shitty sales support, or the people are in the wrong jobs, or the commission isn\'t motivating. Find out which one, and fucking fix it. Your whole job in leadership is to get problems out of the way. Sales is the most transactional part of the business, they will do what pays well if you let them &amp; they are truly sales people at heart.\n\nCustomer success usually gets the short end of the stick... they are treated like they are disposable, and their jobs suck the hardest... they get yelled at... they have to be the bearer of bad news when sales makes promises that are impossible.\n\nBut these people ARE the business as far as your customers are concerned, so it\'s NOT the place to go cheap.

They may need to not outsource these roles to the lowest bidder and go uphill a bit. \n\nFind a way to hit sales in the pocket with trailing commissions related to retention if needed.\n\nLastly, if he has any staff that is a morale problem, they have to be fired.

Now that same firm is testing it. It's been surreal seeing attorneys actually use something I built while messing around.

Current state:

\- Drafts basic provisional patents (working with firm on full patent app generator)

\- Actually works (shocking)

\- Lots of security issues to fix

\- Still figuring out next steps

Lessons learned:

1. Patent formatting is weirdly specific
2. AI hallucinates technical details a lot
3. Lawyers spend too much time on initial drafts
4. Security/privacy is everything with IP

The fun part has been seeing test inventions people try - ""AI-powered socks that sort themselves"" is still my favorite üòÇ

Would love feedback from anyone who's dealt with patents before. Still lots to figure out.

Also not sure on GTM. Thinking initially was target founders but there's not many that need patents and those that do are serious about it and will hire firm.... Thinking now is maybe lawyers will use this internally but other than my friend, most firms have not been very receptive to incorporating AI into their workflow.... (or at least their bosses haven't)

I‚Äôm doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I‚Äôve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners‚Äîthings like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don‚Äôt fit founders‚Äô needs. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts to help shed light on what really matters to founders when choosing a bank.

If you‚Äôre a founder, here are a few quick questions I‚Äôd love your input on:
	1.	Who do you currently bank with, and why did you choose them?
	2.	What were the most important factors in choosing your bank (e.g., fast onboarding, reputation, digital tools)?
	3.	What‚Äôs one thing you wish your banking partner did better?
	4.	At what stage of growth did having a strong banking relationship become critical for your startup?

Feel free to answer any or all of these! Your insights will go into a write-up I‚Äôm working on, and I‚Äôm happy to share the findings if you‚Äôre interested‚Äîjust let me know in the comments.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f63,1gk5yse,How to Build an MVP (not ai generated),"After googling it. I see a lot of articles that were generated by AI.

First, they start with ""WHAT IS MVP?"".

Second, they speak a lot about MVP, not how to build it.

I will try to be as helpful as I can.  
  
1) You can build MVP by yourself.

Not ideal for everyone, especially those who don't know how to code and don't want to code it. Because, let's be honest, it is not everyone, and not everyone needs it. Someone is good at selling and marketing.

Who can:

Just use as simple things as you can, tech stack that you know, reuse all code that you have, don't create a wheel. If you build your MVP via Google Sheets, I can become your friend.

Golden rule:

Use as little money as you could.

2) You can hire dev to build MVP in-house.

Keep in mind that the average dev salary in a year will be from $55k to $75k. Also, you should keep in mind that if you want to hire them, you need someone who is good at the technical part. Because if you are a sales guy and hire a developer without any clue what it is. You will lose a lot of money. Not because he will be bad or he won't do anything. Not like that.

You will lose money because he will do what he thinks is right. Sometimes when developers think he is right, he could be right from the technical side. But he won't be right from the customer side.

Because customers don't care about your fancy tech stack, cloud platform, VPS, and other fancy words. They care about your solution and how much it costs.

3) You can hire developers as freelancers to build MVP.

It will be a good option if you know that freelancer or even if you got contact from someone you trust. If it is not the first two options. I would skip this step. It is risky because freelancers won't take any risks to build your MVP or even run away with money.

Rules from the second step will be exactly the same. If you are good at the dev part, you can hire and divide all projects into smaller tasks. Otherwise, I won't recommend doing it.

4) Using no-code/low-code platforms

Also a good option to consider. Your first MVP should be as simple as it could be. Those platforms are good for creating basic solutions. Especially if your idea is not unique and has a lot of competitors. I would recommend this step to the most 80% of founders. First, you can start with that. If you have enough customers to pay the bills and you can't add more custom functionality, then move to the next steps that I will mention.

5) Partner with a technical co-founder

I would recommend this option if you know that person well enough. Partner in business is like partner in life. You should choose wisely and ask a lot of questions. Most of the time, it won't work. Because there is a lot of ""but."".

6) Working with development agencies

There are a lot of good development agencies. What is the difference between a third step? Good question, I know.

Agency has name, and it takes responsibility. At least it should take :)

Of course, do your own due diligence and choose your own way.

Bonus tip:

If you need help with development agencies, you can write to me. I will try to help with that.",0,startups,1730811188.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gk5yse/how_to_build_an_mvp_not_ai_generated/,experience,"['some tales from the trenches:\n\n1: YOU and your team know it\'s an MVP, but your customer/user does NOT.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fc1,1ggx5l6,What more do I need before pitching to investors?,"Co founder and myself saw enough interest in a gaming genre that we built a quick prototype.  I onboarded my small community from a different genre of game I made to test this new one. Despite it being a new genre, the feedback was positive and we had direction. 

Did my best to promote the demo and future state ideas and we were able to raise $10k with a pre-sale from players. We launched the mvp just a few months later.

Since then we have generated over $30k in revenue. We have only paid $2k for aws game servers and $4k to promote the mvp and grow the player base. Our only other expense is our time. A few hours a week.

We could carry only and continue to slowly develop and ship when time allows. We have jobs and families, but we believe we have something here and we are moving too slowly. 

Are we ripe to seek investment so we can go full time to development and promote faster?

I'm an experienced dev, jr entrepreneur,  and first time founder and have only received grants and hackathon awards. No experience with investors.

 Any advice for next steps are very much appreciated. I don't feel like enough of the game has been developed to truly determine product market fit.

 Not certain if we need to crank these remaining mvp features out asap for user feedback and investor pitch/demo or if what we have in the mvp and our current success is enough to get us funded.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37da4,1gxyqle,[ Lesson Learned ] I Made a Rookie Mistake with My Web Design Studio,"I started my web design studio after quitting my full-time job. I thought creating a stunning website for my business and an Instagram account to showcase my design mastery would eventually bring in clients. And boy, was I wrong.

Then I began cold-calling people to pitch my services. I actually got a good response, with people showing genuine interest. But the problem? I didn‚Äôt know how to close the leads. As a result, despite their initial interest, none of them actually worked with me.

Next, I tried advertising that I would design webpages for free, and you‚Äôd only pay if you liked the design and decided to work with me. Again, I got a good response, but nothing materialized.

What was my mistake? I think I was focused on pitching my services instead of listening to them and quoting prices that would give me good margins. To be honest, both approaches were wrong for me.

Now, I‚Äôve shifted my approach. I listen to my clients and focus on genuinely helping them with their needs. And believe me, this change in mindset has made all the difference. In the last 7 days, I‚Äôve secured two clients‚Äîone from the US and one from Germany‚Äîand I‚Äôve received two more inquiries for work.

I don‚Äôt know if this will apply to everyone, but it worked for me:¬†**focus on the customer‚Äôs needs and problems, and figure out how you can genuinely help them.**¬†Don't worry too much about money. If you are giving value, money will eventually follow.

This is very relatable because almost the same happened to me. Why is it that the same idea could work well for one entrepreneur but seem totally unviable for another entrepreneur?

I know the correct answer is ""execution"" but I'd love a more detailed answer. Like with examples or something.

&gt;

&gt;I started out building the simplest functional page, and then just started working on a SaaS project, learning as I was going. Bubble has an amazing community and forum so the answers to any problems I hit upon were readily available.

&gt;Within a couple of months, I‚Äôd built my first full SaaS product, a video testimonial tool before they were trendy.

&gt;The product failed. I didn't market it and my initial users just didn‚Äôt use it. I assumed video testimonials just weren‚Äôt going to be a thing and moved on.

This one is arguable. It\'s possible to succeed without domain expertise. Sometimes it\'s even helpful not to have it: fresh eyes and all that. But 99% of the time, having domain expertise is a massive advantage. You will already have a deep understanding of problems that need to be solved in the sector, (possibly) how to solve them and (possibly) a network and/or credible standing with your customers.\n\nSkillset. I, as a software engineer, can build some cool software solution. But, can I market it? Can I sell it? Can I raise funds from investors? Lot\'s of people think that stuff is easy, but it\'s not. And they fail. There is a LONG history of ""better"" products losing to ""inferior"" products due to marketing and sales execution.\n\nAbility to learn and adapt. Everyone is different. Some people become very emotionally dug into a particular view point and will ignore evidence that contradicts that viewpoint. Other people bounce from one idea to another, collapsing at the first hurdle and never sticking with anything. It\'s a real skill to know when to quit, when to pivot and when to keep going.\n\nPersonal circumstance. Are you independently wealthy? Can you afford to fail and try again? Can you afford to work on your idea full-time? Do you have a network of people in the same boat as you? Then there\'s a good chance that you\'ll have some success, sooner or later. If you can\'t afford to even take one decent swing at the pitch, then the chances you succeed are very low. You\'re trying to work on your idea around full-time work. You can\'t quit your job, which basically rules-out getting VC funding. The only co-founder you can find will be in the same boat as you. Your options are very limited.\n\nTiming. Are you too early or too late? Sometimes someone will launch a company at just the right time.

Markets can be ripe for certain ideas at specific moments due to trends or consumer behaviours. For instance, if you launched a video testimonial tool in a relatively uninterested market, it may have appeared unviable. A year later, when video testimonials gained traction, another entrepreneur found success.\n\nSecondly, the entrepreneur‚Äôs network and resources matter. Access to mentoring, industry contacts, and funding can significantly impact a venture's growth potential. An entrepreneur with a solid support system might navigate challenges more effectively and adapt their strategies.\n\nLastly, personal passion and drive play a crucial role. Entrepreneurs who are genuinely invested in their idea often exhibit greater resilience and creativity in overcoming obstacles. \n\nThe reality of entrepreneurship encompasses a blend of these variables, making it a less predictable landscape than it might seem at first."", 'Experience is an obvious answer to throw in the mix.\n\nWho do you think has a better chance at founding and running a healthcare startup?

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f2c,1gluj8l,Creating a subreddit as a marketing channel for my platform - First 10 Days,"Hello all, I want to showcase my attempt and take aways from attempting to create a subreddit to try and market my soon to be launching pre-negotiated car deals platform. Thus I created r/CarNegotiation with a bunch of guides and tips and information about how to negotiate down a car and first time buyer guides etc etc.

I want to highlight how difficulty it was to grow, how many views it got and some positives and negatives.

**1. How did I acquire users on the subreddit/views?**

I mainly cross posted to other subreddit with specific information relating to that subreddit. For example, posting the guides on r/CarLeasingHelp r/whatcarshouldIbuy r/carbuying etc etc.

I also built a custom feed on reddit, to which the sorted by new and looked for all new posts that had some relevance to car negotiation and commented my input on them that I felt like, was useful and helpful.

These have been my only sources of traffic, and how many new members and views I get is strictly a function of how many hours I do those two things.

**2. The results**

The results were quite shocking, sitting for about 10 hours constantly engaging in conversation has usually netted me about 30 new subscribers to the subreddit each day, which usually sits around 2,500 and around 600 unique views. I would link the photo of the insights page, but it does not let me here. I'd expect these results to continue, and with full time effort, I can see obtaining around 700 new subscribers a month, and around 50k views, which is a good amount of free traffic, that can grow also.

**3. The Positives**

The traffic is completely for free.

The traffic is targeted and I have many 1 on 1 conversations, great for any business.

Repeatable and consistent for a wide range of businesses.

Has major scalability and can views can become self sustaining if the subreddit grows enough.

You learn a lot about whatever you are talking about. I'd be lying if things I thought I new about car sales were actually incorrect, or new information I was not previously aware of.

Feels good to help people.

**4. The Negatives**

Can't hire employees to fulfill this role. Usually whatever conversations you are having are about information that is not normally known by people, like the intricates of car buying in my example. If I were to hire somebody to do reddit marketing, they wouldn't be able to offer useful information to grow the subreddit.

Takes a large time. The less you work, the less results you see. This becomes problematic for smaller teams where consuming 1 persons time, reducing the output in other areas significantly. The time commit to get to a point where the sub can self-sustain, its really at minimum a year of 40 hours of work, for the self-sustained views to be useful

Can becoming mind numbing at some points, and overloaded at others. Sometimes you feel like your having the exact same conversations over and over again. Other time you have 4 DM's to reply to, 3 comments to reply to, and 2 posts in the subreddit to reply to.

Can be bothersome to enjoy not working, knowing that its directly impacting your views and growth of the subreddit. You see the effect immediately and its undeniable. Its hard to mentally move past this point and not wear on yourself over it.

**5. Conclusion**

Overall, I do think it can work for some people given their circumstances, but for many people it probably won't be the best use of their time. For my company, it is me and 1 other co-founder, and I do front-end development, he does back-end. Since I am doing reddit marketing, no front-end design work is getting done and its slowing down progress in other areas. Ultimately, we are concluding that for us, its better to validate an idea with paid marketing and then see what our conversion rates are to see if we should continue paid ads, or looking to do free marketing like reddit, or drop the project entirely.

With that said, I will continue to grow the subreddit for some time to come, just for research and learning and understanding, and will probably drop some update progress to share what else I might learn.",5,startups,1730997050.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gluj8l/creating_a_subreddit_as_a_marketing_channel_for/,experience,"['This was an interesting read.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37de2,1gw49fe,"Building with urgency, and why I think it matters","Just wanted to throw this one down because I've been getting a lot of questions from founders about losing their motivation and fire to build. 

Every founder goes through a honeymoon phase at the beginning, but like everything, that excitement fizzles out over the long term, especially when things get tough. 

I hope this helps. Enjoy.

\--

Building with urgency is probably one of the most underrated skills a founder can master.

Over the years, I‚Äôve seen too many founders lose focus because they lost their sense of urgency, but I also figured out how some founders regained and even doubled down on their focus by following some simple habits that anyone can use.

But first, let‚Äôs get one thing straight:

If you‚Äôre building something especially in the SaaS space, the idea that ‚Äúgreat things take time‚Äù, can be safely thrown out the window - time is a luxury we don‚Äôt have anymore.¬†

But why?

AI has changed the landscape and it‚Äôs now easier to build software companies than ever before.

But that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶

Every idea has 10+ VC-backed and bootstrapped competitors out there.

Speed and momentum become everything.

That‚Äôs why building with a sense of urgency is a HUGE unlock; because it might be the single biggest thing that will separate you from everyone else.

But what are some ways to do it properly?

1. **Set clear deadlines**¬†‚Äî these could be real or artificial, but you have to really stick to them. They have to be aggressive but realistic. It‚Äôs even better if you can justify the timelines to yourself and your team. Deadlines, especially with consequences create a strong urge to get things done.
2. **Have a mission/north star**¬†‚Äî working towards something bigger than yourself becomes magnetic. While OKRs are great to have, having that purpose alongside timelines creates a potent combination of things to do!
3. **Be accountable**¬†‚Äî this becomes really important when you‚Äôre either a small team or a solopreneur. It‚Äôs a double-edged sword because you‚Äôre not beholden to anyone except yourself and the business. This means you can take as much time as you want on a project and not be at risk of being fired. But if you find that you still can‚Äôt be accountable to yourself, then be accountable to your investors and/or your customers that believe in you. Ironically, accountability towards others is more powerful than towards yourself.
4. **Simplify your roadmap**¬†‚Äî focus on what really matters to move the needle for your biz. Remove all the nice-to-haves and just get the essentials out to the world - remember, done is way better than perfect.
5. **Iterate**¬†‚Äî keep testing and updating the product. But the real key here is that the act of iterating becomes a fly-wheel. As you gather more feedback, you‚Äôll be motivated to correct, improve, and release new updates back to your customers. This is why it‚Äôs so important to get your product into the hands of as many people as possible - it generates that momentum.

The founders who do this well have this maniacal obsession about progress.

They want to see stuff get done, people taking action, and moving the needle as much as possible in the right direction.

What you realize is that when you do this enough times, the notion of urgency becomes the default for you and your team - it becomes deeply embedded in your culture.

Ultimately, build like your future depends on it.",0,startups,1732152338.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gw49fe/building_with_urgency_and_why_i_think_it_matters/,experience,"['I disagree.

These chatbots are specialized for group chats. I have some customers that are quite happy with the product and use it for their own discord servers (maybe a dozen or two). Some use it alone on their own private servers.

In the last half a year, I found a market for roleplay chatbots on Discord and I've been honing my product for group roleplay (of which there are many servers on discord). However, I've recently realized that the majority of roleplayers and/or potential customers are in their teens (14+). I assume they wouldnt exactly have a lot of money to pay.

What is the best pricing model and/or monetization strategy for such customers? microtransactions? monthly subscriptions?

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37da3,1gy6rqe,Is it time to migrate app code?,"Hi everyone, I'm seeking advice on whether now is a good time to migrate my company's app code from FlutterFlow. FlutterFlow has been great for our basic app needs. In this first version, the app is basically Reddit for skincare where users can make posts about different topics and interact with each other. Only photos are allowed, no video. We've recently launched this MVP on the Google and App stores (search 'Skincentric' if interested).

So far, we have 76 users and counting. I've had in depth conversations with our users and they're noticing some of the UI flaws with the app. For example, the scrolling is choppy and pages re-query every time you click to a new one so it never saves the position. Also, we'd like to implement video into the app but that has been a challenge. When we did add video, it slowed the app down drastically. At first, we used Firebase to store the video files, then we were advised to use Supabase but found little difference with SB.

So, we're wondering if cutting out FlutterFlow and just hard coding everything in Dart will help control/solve performance issues? We plan to implement even more complex features that involve machine learning which users have been asking for. FlutterFlow has served us well up until this point but I think its time to migrate. Any advice from experienced developers would help.

I'm doing some consulting work for a start-up, and the founder is looking to streamline the investor experience.  Currently, he's storing everything in Google Docs, such as entity filings, trademarks, and SAFE details. However, he's looking for a better way to share this information with potential investors during the negotiation phase. He's currently thinking a privately accessible website which would house all of these documents, but does anyone have any other ideas?

Long story short, he's looking for a more professional alternative to sending a google doc with hyperlinks to potential investors.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fc7,1ggp2bt,How can I improve in my leadership? Team lost all motivation when cash got tight.,"Looking to vent a little bit and would appreciate some advice. My co-founder and I had brought on two people to the team that were a great fit at the time. Motivated, skilled and ready to make the dream come true. We offered them a decent amount of equity being early team members and taking on some of the responsibilities of core team. 

This was back when we had more runway. Recently we had run into a lot of unexpected costs and cash became really tight. My co-founder and I have always been the type of people that advocate for communication and coming together to figure out how to get through hard times together. Him and I have gone through some ROUGH months of having no money and finding ways to liquidate personal assets to help fund the dream. My co-founder went so far as to give up all his monthly pay to help support the team when we hit this shit month. Yet cash was still tight and we had to forgo pay until this next check came in. 

The two guys we brought on seemed to view the situation like they were employees not getting paid for their work. I get it, I want to make sure everyone is taken care of. I am not expecting free work, but with giving away equity I was expecting the understanding and knowing that sometimes money is tight, but it will be worth it in the long run. 

Ever since this happened both of the newer team members have seemed to lose all motivation and drive to be working with us. Not accomplishing tasks, not showing real interest, wanting to work from home. It's so frustrating because I really just wish they would communicate with me on what is going on, even so much as saying, ""hey it's hard for me to feel motivated when no money is coming in"" , I would have so much understanding for that. But nothing? Just half ass-ing it, putting attention else where and showing none of the commitment and drive we saw early on? Now it feels weird to keep paying them when they both have literally put in no work besides some data entry over two weeks. 

  
I guess the advice I would appreciate is helping me understand where I went wrong. Was it too soon to bring on team members like that, and should I have kept them as employees instead of having the expectations my co-founder and I share? How could I have motivated better communication? I want to keep learning as a founder and this experience was a little defeating as it seems no one will be as motivated and driven for our product as me and my co-founder are. Thanks in advance.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f3a,1glf5wn,How to validate ANY business idea before building it (and wasting time and money),"**Experienced Founder/ CEO here.**  
  
My team and I have bootstrapped an education company from 5k to nearly $1M revenue in 2 years.  
But I've had some other business ideas that **failed BIG time**.   
  
This is what this post is about and how to avoid that failure.  
  
So, I did try SaaS, even Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, and more. **ALL failed.**

And i hope this post helps you to not do the same mistakes that i did when i asked myself ""what online business can i start?""

I've failed not because these models or ideas of business don't work - but because I've never¬†actually **VALIDATED if there is actually real demand for this.**

I call this the classic rookie mistake for first time founders.   
And I've fallen into the trap multiple times tbh. **(5x to be exact!)**

I've never talked to real breathing human beings one-to-one if they¬†**really**¬†**needed**¬†**this and would spend money on it**.

So I've blew money that i did not have, a lot of time and energy into a thing that i've build - but - surprise, surprise -nobody wanted it.   
  
However is reading this thinking about starting something new I truthfully hope this will not happen to you - now you know this pitfall!

**So what can we learn from this?**  
Whatever business model or market you pick, make sure you¬†**validate first**.

Validation is just a fancy word for making sure people are¬†**interested**¬†in something(your product/service) -¬†**before**¬†your building your product/service.

Let me say this again:

**Validate First.**  
**Build Second**

And we want to validate¬†**CHEAP**¬†and¬†**FAST**.

ok, but how we do that?

**Here's what the smart people do:**

Before spending a single dollar, create what I call a ""*Smoke Test*""

When plumbers fix pipes, they pump smoke through them first.

If there's a leak, you'll see the smoke before any water damage happens. - Easy. 

And in business, it's the same concept:

You're testing for ""leaks"" in your business idea before pouring in real money (water)

**Example:**  
Let's say you wanna do a premium coffee delivery subscription service. Ok Great.

Instead of buying inventory and spending your 5k right away, you create a simple landing page that says  
""*Rare Premium Coffee Beans Delivered Monthly¬†to you home* *-*¬†***Join the Waitlist*** ""

There are¬†**2 ways**¬†to do that:

***You Spend Money:***  
*Now run $50 worth of Facebook ads to your target audience. (paid)*  
  
*If your don't want to spend any*¬†***money***¬†*- you have to spend*¬†***time***.

***You Spend Time:***  
find your people online and tell them something like ""*hi, i'm thinking about to start a monthly Rare Coffee Beans Delivery -- would you be interested -* ***join the waitinglist***""

If 100 people view your page and nobody signs up - you've saved yourself $4,950. - happy days -  good for you.

If 30-40 people join your waitlist - you've got¬†**proof of interest - and a business.**

This is exactly what Dropbox did - they made a video showing their ""product"" before writing a single line of code. Or a more recent example is Elon Musk and his Cybertruck.

Dropbox collected 75,000+ email addresses overnight. **(and they did not even wrote a single line of code yet)**

Elon Musk collected idk how many emails + 100millions deposits of people overnight. (and he did not build a sigle truck yet)

That's validation for¬†**true**¬†**demand**.

So all we do is simply and cheaply collect signs of interest before we get moving.

I feel like a lot pf people are missing this step.

It wasn‚Äôt easy, and I didn‚Äôt follow some ‚Äúperfect formula.‚Äù My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I‚Äôm not sharing this as an attempt to ‚Äúgain karma‚Äù or whatever and I‚Äôm not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here‚Äôs the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I‚Äôd ‚Äúmade it.‚Äù Spoiler: I hadn‚Äôt.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started‚Äîbroke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I‚Äôd ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. ‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn‚Äôt last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he‚Äôd quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in ‚ÄúPrint on Demand‚Äù platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn‚Äôt know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn‚Äôt about print on demand‚Äîit was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Make it higher quality.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she‚Äôs the skeptical type, but she was on board‚Äîwhich made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it‚Äôs not great, it won‚Äôt last.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn‚Äôt have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here‚Äôs the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you‚Äôre stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

‚ÄúThe difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it‚Äôs literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it‚Äôs a choice.‚Äù  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It‚Äôs up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d53,1h0xnqw,Can my 10 year old company get VC funding?,"Hello! This is my first post so please go easy on me. 

I run a home service business that does $1.5m in revenue. We have been in business for 10 years as of last month. 

Over the years there have been MANY ups and downs, including nearly going out of business multiple times. Luckily, we have stabilized and now have a very healthy business. 

We have always had visions of being a national company but in our specific industry there seems to be an array of obstacles that make it nearly impossible to scale(we have tried many times). The only companies that do, do so by selling franchises. Franchises that turnover very often, due to franchisee burn out. 

As a tech person, I figured there had to be a better way using technology. 

So in the past 3 years I have been developing software that will mitigate the obstacles, giving a clear path to scalability. 

The software is essentially an OS/platform for our entire company to operate on. It makes everything more efficient and is designed specifically around our business operations. Instead of turning it into a SAAS I want to use it to scale and become the market leader in our industry. 

My question is simple: is this something a VC would be interested in? Or do they typically not invest in older companies?

We have: Live MVP, Team, Traction, Proven Business Model, Clear path to scalability 

You may ask why I need funding. 

Here is my answer:
I have bootstrapped for 10 years and have done everything in my power to keep this thing alive. We are currently profitable but in order to build this thing correctly I need to hire better talent and if I try to push for more revenue it gets harder to manage the software development. I need money to give me some breathing room.

Any and all feedback is welcome.

I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you - sounds like you‚Äôve got a nice personal business (admittedly don‚Äôt know your EBITDA). But this isn‚Äôt remotely VC, not by a million miles. Literally. Some ‚ÄúVC‚Äù startups focus only on user growth and not revenues/EBITDA and thats ok for a specific model (and requires VC funding to keep the lights on during that period) from the git go. But thats not you, you‚Äôve built a small business over 10 years.  Other startups are able to get those revenues right from the beginning, but again, thats not you. After 10 years you‚Äôre ‚Äúonly‚Äù at $1.5MM a year.  I‚Äôve had that after just 6 months on the market and barely got ‚Äúvc‚Äù funding from ‚Äúvc‚Äù that were interested in that kind of thing.\n\nVC ‚â† investor. VC is a specific set of professional investors, investing other people‚Äôs money, with very specific mind set looking for fairly specific returns/IRR. In the SaaS world, that‚Äôs gonna be a $500MM-$1B valuation in just 2-5years (they expect 1-2 more raises with increasing valuations). That ain‚Äôt you, sorry. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, you need to go find a different class of investor. A neurosurgeon ‚â† orthopedic surgeon, though both are ‚Äúsurgeons‚Äù, and stop thinking ‚ÄúVC‚Äù as your investor. You need to go out and network and find successful, older 45+ (really semi retired) year olds who are semi successful local businesspeople  who are willing to invest in interesting small companies that could throw them off a few hundred thousands off in dividends a year in a few years. \n\nYou say you have a stable business? Go to a local bank. Take out debt. Build it that way. \n\nGood luck, genuinely pulling for you!', 'Unless you can prove that others will buy this platform and can scale to $1 billion, no smart vc would be interested. \n\nPlease don‚Äôt take it to mean it‚Äôs not a good idea or can‚Äôt make a lot of money. \n\nVCs cannot bet on singles doubles or triples. They can only invest in products that have the potential to be grand slams. \n\nI‚Äôd find other investor groups that actually care about funding a profitable business that has potential to make real profits. \n\nPlenty of investors and investor groups do this. It just ain‚Äôt VCs.', 'How much profit do you have? P/E or growth equity may be the better route for you depending on your answer. For a P/E firm the prospect of you sharing your software with the rest of the roll up they‚Äôd do later on is likely interesting to them. \n\nAlso if you‚Äôre in the US there‚Äôs new tax rules on profits if using overseas developers that‚Äôd make taking VC money and doing growth over profit (yuk, I know) more appealing.', 'I would consider this.

Plenty of companies work on one thing for many years, pivot and then see that hockey stick growth that gets VC investment. \n\nIf you are not planning to release the software publically and instead just have it be the platform for your previous business then I don't see why many would choose to invest unless its so clearly going to give your existing business incredibly rapid growth but again they will probably question why you wouldn't just get into the software game with much higher margins than home services.  With that said there are many more investors than just VCs and many who do invest in more traditional businesses like yourselves. \n\nI think you need to seperate the two.  Create a new company which could take initial capital from yourself, existing employees or the old company that is then the place you build this software.

Here's the ONE thing I'd do differently:



Stop dreaming about being a founder.

Start learning from the best ones.



The uncomfortable truth:

The best founders didn't start as founders.

They started as exceptional employees at rocket ships.



Here's why this matters:



1. Learning on Someone Else's Playground

\- You see real scaling problems

\- You learn what breaks at scale

\- You understand what ""good"" looks like

(Without burning your own savings)



2. Building a Real Network

Not through:

\- Random LinkedIn connections

\- Startup meetups

\- Cold DMs



But by:

\- Delivering exceptional work

\- Being the go-to problem solver

\- Making real impact



3. Developing Founder DNA

\- Pattern recognition of what works

\- Understanding of market dynamics

\- Network of future co-founders

(All while getting paid)



The Secret Recipe at 22:

Join the fastest-growing company that'll have you.

Become indispensable.

Learn everything.



Your ideas will mature.

Your network will compound.

Your skills will skyrocket.



Hot Take:

2 years at a hypergrowth company &gt; 5 years of ""hustling"" solo



Think about it:

Every great founder story has a ""before I started...""



What's yours going to be?

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d3e,1h1iei6,How I'm losing loads of money every single month,"Hi everyone,

This will be a longer read, but I genuinely believe you‚Äôll get a lesson or two out of it.

First off, I want to clarify that this post isn‚Äôt intended as an advertisement. If it does come off that way, I assure you that‚Äôs not my intention. We‚Äôre just trying to share our journey, insights, and some of the successes we've achieved so far. We‚Äôre actually not interested in taking on any additional clients right this second, which is why I‚Äôm not including our agency name or specific details about how to contact us.

Before I dive into the details, everything I‚Äôm about to share is based on actual results, client feedback, and hard-won experience. If you have questions or want more insight, feel free to reach out ‚Äî I‚Äôm more than happy to chat and share details that could help.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

We run a lead generation agency focused on management agencies within a pretty unique field (rhymes with Only Sans). The industry itself isn‚Äôt widely discussed (morality debates are common), but it‚Äôs incredibly active. We operate differently from most service providers because we prioritize long-term value and genuine results over quick wins. With backgrounds in high-ticket sales, cold outreach, and lead generation, we‚Äôve built systems that produce results few others in this space can offer.

**Operations and Services**

It‚Äôs been exactly a year since we launched, and in that time, we‚Äôve had the chance to work with some of the more established agencies in the industry. By networking at conferences, participating in Q&amp;A sessions, and building relationships with experts, we‚Äôve established a reputation as a reliable partner in this space.

Our approach is straightforward: we use Instagram to source, find, and connect with creators. By focusing exclusively on creators from first-world countries who already have a proven track record, we‚Äôre able to provide quality that typical marketplaces often don‚Äôt. Our goal is consistency and reliability; if a creator doesn‚Äôt work out, we provide a replacement to keep our clients covered. This has been key in helping us stand out in a crowded market.

Generally, our payment structure is designed to be flexible based on each client‚Äôs needs. We charge a base rate that scales with the number and type of creators the client requires, with custom packages available if they have specific niche or demographic preferences. This setup allows us to offer both straightforward solutions and tailored deals to meet diverse client needs while maintaining quality and reliability in the leads we deliver.

**Additional Services**

One thing we‚Äôve learned is that adding complementary services has strengthened our client relationships. For example, if a client‚Äôs Instagram profile isn‚Äôt up to scratch, we offer rebranding support, which around 90% of clients take us up on. This additional service keeps clients engaged and reinforces our reputation for going above and beyond.

**How We‚Äôre Different from Marketplaces**

Marketplaces are technically our competition, but we‚Äôve chosen a different approach. Most marketplaces rely on creators from lower-income countries, which often leads to issues around language barriers, commitment, and reliability. Once any initial guarantee ends, these creators may leave, creating a new set of challenges for agencies. Our focus is on creators who already speak fluent English, have a track record, and meet specific standards for quality and professionalism. Rather than signing on anyone, we make sure creators are a solid match for both our standards and the needs of our clients.

Interestingly, some marketplaces have approached us to partner, offering to sell our creators through their platforms in exchange for a commission. We decided against it, as it would dilute the exclusivity and reputation we‚Äôve built. Instead, we recently found a way to partner through a white-label model, which allows us to expand our reach without compromising our brand or standards.

**Growth and Challenges**

We‚Äôve built a community of over 800 agencies on Telegram in just a year, which has been invaluable for growth. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs only the two of us. My co-founder and I handle every single part of the operation ‚Äî from marketing to client communications, sourcing leads, and fulfilling orders. It‚Äôs a heavy load, and while we‚Äôre no strangers to hard work, we know our time could be better spent if we had more systems in place. Right now, we‚Äôre turning away clients because we simply don‚Äôt have enough hours in the day.

Despite this, we‚Äôve managed to generate over six figures in our first year, and we‚Äôre proud of it. However, we know we‚Äôre missing out on even more substantial growth ‚Äî potentially an additional $50k/month ‚Äî simply because we‚Äôre operating at maximum capacity.

**Our Scaling Goals**

The field we‚Äôre in isn‚Äôt easy, and it‚Äôs filled with companies that don‚Äôt always operate with the best practices. Our commitment to honest, reliable service has allowed us to build a strong client base. That said, we‚Äôre currently facing some financial challenges, partially due to the mistake of mixing personal and business finances early on. Not to mention, we‚Äôre handling everything from A to Z (client communication, lead sourcing/closing, marketing, etc.), which is extremely time-consuming. With capital, we‚Äôd be able to delegate most of the tasks, and the two of us could start prioritizing actual growth. This is why we‚Äôre seriously considering funding, to help us stabilize and make strategic moves for long-term growth.

We have a solid scaling plan that could allow us to reach $50k/month in revenue at minimum, mostly by expanding our Instagram outreach (running multiple accounts, each representing a creator). But we‚Äôd need support to set up the necessary systems to automate and scale efficiently.

**What We‚Äôre Looking For**

We‚Äôre at a point where we‚Äôre considering funding options to help us level up. Has anyone here been in a similar position? If you‚Äôve navigated scaling a small team or managed exponential growth in a service-based startup, we‚Äôd love to hear about your experience. We‚Äôre even open to discussing equity if it makes sense for the right partner.

Any insights from fellow founders would be really appreciated.

This is not a na√Øve implementation and has gone through many iterations.\n\n\\- User creates an interactive resume where they can put much more information in it and actually talk about their experiences ahead of time. There\'s an AI Agent (chatbot) who can answer questions both on and off the resume. For example, their AI agent can ask them questions about their background and answer it with a story or something.\n\n\\- User can self-rate their skills but the AI agent requires they provide evidence backing up the rating, with a standardized scale to be judged against. When viewing the interactive resume, you\'ll see a gray progress bar (from 0 to 5) for ""not validated"" and a colored one for ""validated"".\n\n\\- User can use said interactive resume to apply to other jobs by generating a PDF personalized for the job that contains the same information as a job fit report. The PDF links to their interactive resume and also is de-biased for the purposes of forwarding to a manager via email. The user side is a freemium model, so the user gets value even if they\'re not a fit for your job. I plan on adding ""missions"" soon that will turn your job fit into a sort of scavenger hunt where you earn credits for finding jobs you\'re a good fit in.\n\n\\- Applying, once the interactive resume is created, is similar to ""easy apply"" except the candidate sees the same thing you do. There won\'t be applicant spam, just the short list. Additionally, they see how many other candidates are ahead of them in terms of job fit.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d30,1h1yryk,Should I start a startup or take a break and focus on mental health,"Hey all - just looking for some advice. I was eng lead at a startup that shut down in September, and to be honest, it took quite a toll on my mental health over the past year. The CEO/CTO were convinced it was engineering execution that was the root cause. While we had some eng issues, the founders had fired all existing customers a year ago and we spent the last year going through a series of ill thought out pivots. Every Monday I would meet with the CEO/CTO and essentially get blamed for the startup not working, and that started to really affect me.  
  
I started ideating on startup ideas in June when the writing on the wall was clear since I had always wanted to do a startup, and it felt like a good next step. However, after the startup shut down, I realized what a toll on my self confidence it had taken. I started developing issues like anxiety, mild depression and burnout. I took a bit of a break over and I'm doing better on those fronts, but not 100% better. Trying to ideate on startup ideas right after also didn't help - feelings of being lost and unsure also really surfaced.  
  
I've been considering whether I should take a bit of a break from startup land and take a job and just focus on improving my mental health, rather than continuing to ideate. I suppose what's stopping me is doing a startup has been a dream of mine for a long time, and it feels a bit like giving up.

Note: I have written by transcribing my speech to text through AI and making mods. Just so if it matters.  
  
Hey young entrepreneurs, I wanted to share an insight into what real entrepreneurship is like. From the outside, it might look flashy and glamorous, especially when you hear about someone making an exit from their startup. It can seem like they‚Äôve achieved everything in life. But the truth? It‚Äôs far from that.

I graduated from IIT Madras in 2016, and even before finishing college, I started a digital payments startup. Back then, digital payments were on the rise but weren‚Äôt as common as they are today. Paytm wasn‚Äôt the giant it is now‚Äîit only began scaling aggressively after demonetization.

So, we got good initial traction. Just before graduating, I managed to raise funding as a student, which was rare at the time. I skipped placements and went full-time with my startup after graduation. Things were great at first; we scaled fast. But soon, we burned through our funding with cashbacks and user incentives, all in the name of growth. One and a half years in, we realized we hadn‚Äôt figured out a way to monetize our users, and with Paytm aggressively taking over the market, no investor was interested in funding smaller startups like mine. It was a dead end.

Two of my co-founders decided to leave and move on. But I stayed. I wanted to give it one more shot. With barely any funds left, I had to let go of 90% of our team. Those who stayed were there voluntarily, without salaries‚Äîmyself included. I moved from Hyderabad back to my hometown, Bhopal, and turned a room in my house into an office to save rent and living expenses.

Through my network and reputation, I managed to raise a small round of funding, and we pivoted to a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending model. This time, I had learned my lesson: the model needed to be profitable from day one. And it was. Over the next year, we saw great growth. It felt like we were finally on the right path. I was enjoying a good salary and living well.

But just when things were going great, the RBI introduced new regulations for P2P lending, and we weren‚Äôt able to secure the required NBFC license. At 22 or 23, it was hard for us to meet the conditions needed to get that license. So, in 2018, I sold my startup to a larger company that could navigate the regulations.

Now, many people think that when you sell a startup, your life is set, and you‚Äôre rolling in cash. The reality is, most startup acquisitions are stock swaps. In my case, most of my deal was in stock, not cash. So, while I joined this new company as part of the acquisition and have had an amazing time working with them‚Äîhelping with fundraising, strategic planning, and financial modeling‚Äîmy financial gains are tied up in stock that I can‚Äôt just cash out.

For the past five years, my role has been great, my salary has been good‚Äîbetter than market rates even‚Äîfreedom to do what and how i want, but that‚Äôs not the whole story. Entrepreneurship doesn‚Äôt come with a sense of security. With a steady job at a big company like Google, Amazon, or Visa, you know that even if there‚Äôs a bad quarter or a global crisis like the pandemic, your job and income are likely secure. In startups, it‚Äôs different. One bad year, one bad regulation, and you could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Look at Byju‚Äôs or Dunzo‚Äîbig names, but even they face these struggles.

As a founder, the mental strain is relentless. When people say they haven‚Äôt taken a day off in years, it‚Äôs not about skipping vacations. It‚Äôs about never being able to shut off your mind. Even when I went on my first vacation after getting married, I ended up working for 3-4 days out of a 7-day trip. Imagine planning for an international trip and ending up like this. (An understanding partner works wonders)

Even now, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about my current startup‚Äîwhere we‚Äôre headed, how to ensure our model is sustainable, and how to secure funding. There will never be peace of mind, not for the founder at least. Because you know that more than your life, the 100 people that are employed with you, there life and financial stability is at risk if anything goes wrong. There families will be in trouble.  
As for me,  until we either get listed or a major cash acquisition happens, my main source of wealth‚Äîmy stocks‚Äîremains locked up.

So, here‚Äôs what I want to tell you: entrepreneurship is amazing if you want freedom and the chance to make an impact. But if you want security, it‚Äôs a different story. You might make good money, but security? That‚Äôs a luxury most entrepreneurs don‚Äôt have. Even today, despite earning well, I don‚Äôt have the peace of mind that comes with knowing that my income is guaranteed six months from now. Regulations could change, something unexpected could happen, and all the work put into the startup could be wiped out.

If you‚Äôre going to dive into entrepreneurship, be ready for the ride. Be prepared to commit 15-20 years of your life to reach that one big success. The risks are high, and so are the potential rewards. But if you‚Äôre someone who values security and wants consistent income without the constant mental battle, a job at a big company might be a better choice.

That‚Äôs the real face of entrepreneurship‚Äîthe struggles, the sacrifices, the constant grind. If you‚Äôre up for it, it can be incredibly rewarding, but know what you‚Äôre signing up for.

Our tech enables the rapid creation of professional-grade, personalized meal plans, covering all 46 USDA-recommended nutrients and accounting for allergies, dietary preferences, and food restrictions.

Unlike most solutions out there, it‚Äôs **not AI-based** and doesn‚Äôt use scraped data; instead, it‚Äôs driven by a meticulously curated database and deterministic calculations.

2. **GTM strategy**: Given our target markets (B2B, healthcare, potential API integrations), what are the best channels or strategies to gain traction?
3. **Potential partnerships**: Any insights on partnerships or industry connections that could help us gain early adopters?

Right now, one company is interested in using the tech via API but we're looking at various other use cases as well.

(I‚Äôm aware my startup is still a long way off this, but just out of curiosity I have a few questions).

When raising pre-seed, how much is expected to be factored in for my salary? I understand that founders should pay themselves minimum, but if I have committed to certain expenses e.g mortgage/kids, then I will need to have that covered - and if I earn around ¬£96k then would I ask that as a salary? 

What if I want to add another co-founder on board and they‚Äôre in a similar position? 

A comfortable salary would allow us to work on the startup 100% with no distractions, so would a VC firm prefer this?

Currently I am working full time - but after raising the pre-seed, how much time would I have to quite my job? I‚Äôm assuming this is something that can be negotiated.

Or could I go down to working part-time say 2 days a week, and then pay myself less salary from pre-seed?

How are funds distributed? Say I have asked for ¬£500k is that deposited in one lump sump into a business account, or would the company receive a certain amount of funding per month for 12 months?

Is there much flexibility on how funds can be spent, say I initially was spending 40% on product development, is there enough autonomy to raise this to 50% if needed?

Is it expected with pre-seed to have a runway of around 12-18 months ? Or can you spend pre-seed money like bootstrapping and spend only as needed ?

Terms I‚Äôm assuming vary, but generally looking at between 10-20% equity for VC? Are there any terms that generally get included in pre-seed contracts, like certain milestones to be met, before raising another round?

To get his first users, he started by reaching out to influencers and small businesses in his network . beacuse he got a powerful network he offered free trials and personalized demos to get the ball rolling.

At first, he was obsessed with feedback. He was constantly asking everyone for their opinion, from his mom to his dog. But I told him, ‚ÄúDude, chill out. You don‚Äôt need to listen to everyone. Focus on your early adopters.‚Äù

So, he started emailing his first users directly. He‚Äôd ask them specific questions like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your biggest pain point with social media scheduling?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat feature would you love to see next?‚Äù

**But things weren't as simple as he thought.**¬†He got feedback from all sorts of channels: emails, DMs, even random messages on social media. Some people were honest, others were just trying to be nice. And then there were the friends and family who were too scared to give real feedback.

It was a total mess! he was starting to think about giving up. I totally disagreed. I knew his tool could be so helpfull So, we came up with a plan: create a small Discord community where users could share their thoughts and ideas. It worked! People started to open up and share honest feedback Seeing how much this simple idea helped my friend, I realized there was a bigger opportunity. I remembered that day when I told him to focus on early adopters. I thought, ""Why not help others too?"" It's a win-win situation.

So, I started sharing my experience on various online communities, helping other founders collect feedback more efficiently.

For those who do digital marketing, I believe you know the best performing content for businesses still remains video content. Yet, businesses still don‚Äôt make use of videos. After talking to over 100 business owners, the common reasons were ‚Äúhigh cost‚Äù, ‚Äúlack of time‚Äù and ‚Äúno video experience‚Äù

Professional looking videos are expensive to make, and that‚Äôs true.

So I created this animated outro video template for small businesses to use and showcase up to 10 services, contains a logo placeholder, call to action, and contact details.

I thought to bring it on here and let you know about this product you can use to create better videos.

Do you think you will find this useful? Come and join the waitlist! I‚Äôve got other design and animation products in the works.

I‚Äôm kinda new to this but I created a product and have 10 users(not all active all the time) and I‚Äôm solo founder and and building it on my own and taking user feedback etc etc. 
Recently I had a call with someone at an early stage VC(they write $25k-$125k check at 2.5%) and I was able to explain most of the part in the best way possible but then can question about valuation and I just randomly said I value my company to be X million and felt as if I am lying.
So my question is how do you answer such questions? 
Like how much I want to raise? How much you think the company is worth? At a very very early stage(MVP and beta testing)?

How true is it in this sub? Anyone here with a firsthand story where it's first and foremost not giving up that helped them?

I am asking because I have a chance to dedicate a year of my time to attempt my own business. The idea I have - which comes from a real problem I observed at one of my previous workplaces - is a niche, B2B, tech infrastructure solution which can save businesses money and customers. There are only few competitors I've found so far doing this (one of them is backed by Y Combinator), and I am afraid I don't know how to sell it - as a I never did this before. 

And so I am wondering what my chances are with only the technical know-how, but no previous experience in running a company - especially the selling part of it - if I do my best no matter what?

Sure, nobody can answer that for me. But are there any people here who believe it's their perseverance that lead to success?

Without knowing more about your business, it\'s hard to make a blanket recommendation. However, there are some fundamental channels pretty much every growth marketer should be working on:\n\n\\- Email marketing. It\'s an ""owned"" audience and one of the least expensive to repeatedly reach. The list should be growing and there should be a regular cadence of email newsletters as well as some automations set up.\n\n\\- SEO. This takes time to pay off, but a good growth marketer will have a repeatable process with structured work to show that it will pay off when content starts ranking in 3-6 months minimum.\n\n\\- Testing offers and optimizing conversion rates. It\'s not uncommon that a business has plenty of traffic but no strong offer, or a page that doesn\'t convert well as the bottleneck for sales velocity. A good growth marketer will work on redesigning those elements and adding content that supports conversion such as value propositions, social proof, etc.\n\n\\- Brand awareness. Growth comes from reach. Many businesses get stuck in performance marketing mode - clearing out the bottom of the funnel and measuring solely on cost-per-acquisition. This inevitably has plateaus even if there are millions of people searching for what you sell because you\'re competing with other brands or solutions, making it cost prohibitive to a point. A solid growth marketer will be able to communicate the value of a good brand awareness strategy leading to most valuable traffic you can get: branded search and direct.\n\nYou might not find all that in one person.

I felt that there was a massive gap as far as searching for opportunities and gathering resources within my field, hence me making the job board. Now that I've gotten here though... I'm not sure what to do next. I've steadily been growing a social following (very small) on LinkedIn, and have been having a go at making TikToks centered around my startup. I've been steadily growing site viewership (couple hundred a day), but it's not translating into subscriptions. I currently have a paywall on my job board ($5/wk, $15/mo and $30/yr). I've gotten a whopping 1 subscriber, which is amazing, I don't want to sound ungrateful since this is the first project I've ever built that I was able to get anyone to deem it good enough to open their wallet, but since that initial subscriber... nothing. My question then is, should I remove the paywall all together for now to make it more accessible and get more eyeballs on it? I would refund my one subscriber if I make it free. My monetization would then strictly be on companies purchasing job posts, but truthfully my job board is nowhere close to bringing in enough traffic to warrant a company's recruiting/HR team to buy a spot.

Also, as far as ""marketing"" I set up automations that create an organization post on the company's LinkedIn page so every hour it posts a new job with a link to apply for the job on my board (no subscription required). Then, like I said before, creating TikToks centered around the job board and questions about the industry.

I'm thinking about buying a company that does text to speech (like speechify, but smaller). Hoping to list some key facts and get perspectives as I need to decide soon. Let me know if you want other information (I know I'm leaving a lot out, but trying to focus on the major concerns):

* paying 3x free cash flows in cash on close; no future payments/earnouts
* Annual recurring revenue (ARR) has been slightly declining for 18 months (-7%/year)
* nearly 2k trials in the last year with 29% conversion rate
* net churn is 25% (ouch) - exit survey indicates apathy with product, mismatch of expectations, bugs, and missing features are the main causes of cancellation

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old non-technical CEO of a tech startup in the textile industry. My journey began about 5-6 months ago when I built an MVP(3 months ago) on Bubble.io. Despite being a no-code platform, it helped me attract 80+ users within a 2km radius, and I‚Äôve even seen some organic growth. Recently, I found a tech co-founder who‚Äôs now rebuilding the product with proper coding, as Bubble has its limitations for the features we need. Along the way, I also onboarded a CMO (a close friend) during my marketing efforts.

Here‚Äôs where I need advice:

Before starting this, I owned a textile manufacturing unit and made a decent living. But since diving into the startup, I‚Äôve struggled to balance both worlds. Recently, I closed down the manufacturing business because the building owner rented the space to someone else. Now I‚Äôm all-in on the startup, but it‚Äôs not generating enough revenue to support me yet.

My family (especially my dad) wants me to return to manufacturing to make a living until the startup becomes viable. They‚Äôre hesitant about me investing personal funds (up to 50 lakhs INR) into the startup, even though I believe in its potential. On the other hand, I keep hearing advice to bootstrap for as long as possible and avoid diluting equity early on.

So, I‚Äôm at a crossroads:

1. Should I restart manufacturing on the side to stay afloat while slowly building the startup?

2. Should I try to convince my family and invest personal funds?

3. Or should I dilute equity and raise external funding now to fully focus on the startup?

I‚Äôd love to hear from fellow founders, especially those who‚Äôve faced similar situations. How did you balance financial stability with chasing your startup dream?

However, it‚Äôs crucial to evaluate if your startup is not just promising but also on the path to traction. Growth is key here: Is your user base growing consistently enough that, with more time and resources, revenue will soon cover your costs?\n\nMy recommendation would be to avoid going all-in with your personal funds right now. Instead, set clear milestones and a timeline: for example, a 6-month runway where you track user growth, product development, and revenue progress. After those 6 months, reassess if the growth rate justifies further investment or if you need to pivot or scale back.\n\nIf possible, I‚Äôd also explore ways to generate interim income that don‚Äôt require restarting full-scale manufacturing. Can you consult in the textile industry, or do something else part-time to keep yourself financially stable without detracting too much from the startup? That way, you‚Äôll have the breathing room to focus on scaling while protecting your personal funds.\n\nRaising external funding is an option, but keep in mind investors will want to see traction too. If you‚Äôre not there yet, you might dilute more equity than necessary at this stage. Instead, focus on building the foundation to raise on better terms later.\n\nIt‚Äôs all about balancing risk and runway while giving your startup the time it needs to prove itself. !']"

A bit of context first. I have a small community development agency. Started this way back 2019. Had a bunch of clients during the WEB 3 surge, where projects needed a community manager or a team to handle their community. Been a solid run till Q4 of 2022. Never needed to do outbound because of the early connections I've made, we did a solid job and got clients solely from referrals. Started with a 3 man team, went all the way to 48 contractual team members, down to 24. Right now, I basically have access to 24 team members waiting for tasks, because we have no clients. At the same time, I'm trying to penetrate the social media industry since social medias are also communities.

To add to that, one of my longest client who turned into a good friend, stole my idea of a tool that helps communities thrive online. Since he's more liquid to develop such tools, he went at it and made his own.

Do you have tips on how to establish a good system for generating leads? From where I am, cost of living is not expensive, and I'll be more than happy to make consistent monthly gains rather than 1 big lump sum.

Been looking to start a company and get into a startup accelerator within the next few years. Right now, I am employee #1 at a startup that is going well. But I'm wondering if it would be better for my future pitches to VCs if I had experience working at a FAANG company.

I previously worked at a large tech company (though not FAANG), and honestly didn't feel like I learned much there. I think the case might be the same at FAANG‚ÄîI'm concerned that it might not provide the hands-on learning I'm getting now. However, I'm considering whether having FAANG on my resume would look better from an optics standpoint when applying to accelerators or pitching to future investors.

As far as actually starting a company, I know the hands-on experience I'm gaining now is more valuable. But it's more about how future VCs and accelerators might perceive my background. Would they value the brand recognition of FAANG experience over being an early employee at a successful startup?

What do you guys think? Is it better to stick with my current hands-on role, or would making a move to a FAANG company improve my chances with VCs purely from an optics perspective?

Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37db6,1gx88la,My first startup failed ‚Äì Here are 10 things I wish I'd do differently,"I dedicated two years of my life to a startup that ultimately failed. We were trying to build a mobile app which would simplify the life of people with diabetes. The whole journey was interesting but also a tough experience, so here are the mistakes I made and the valuable lessons I learned:

1. **All founders were technical:**
   * We were three founders, all technical, with no experience or motivation for marketing and sales.
   * A team needs balance. You can‚Äôt ignore the business side of things.
2. **Overcomplicating the MVP:**
   * We built way too many features and developed the app simultaneously for both Android and iOS.
   * It would have been much better to validate the idea on a single platform and focus on one core feature first.
3. **No competition isn‚Äôt a good thing:**
   * We did a research of competitors but we haven't find any. We thought a lack of competitors was a sign of opportunity, but it should be a warning sign instead. If no one else is in the space, it most of the time means there‚Äôs no demand for a product like this.
4. **Skipping idea validation and feedback:**
   * We didn‚Äôt validate our idea or gather feedback from potential users.
   * If we‚Äôd spent a few weeks talking to people, we could‚Äôve identified their real pain points and built something they actually needed.
5. **Ignoring monetization:**
   * We didn‚Äôt think about how we‚Äôd make money at all. We should think about that from the start.
6. **No dedicated marketing effort:**
   * We spent hundreds of hours building the product but no one was focused on marketing.
   * You need someone on the team who would put as much effort into marketing as the developers do into building.
7. **Changing habits of your users is extremely hard:**
   * Our product required users to change their routines which is a huge challenge. A better approach would‚Äôve been solving a problem they already had, not trying to create new behaviors.
8. **Wasting money on tools and infrastructure:**
   * We spent quite a lot of money on hosting, email services, certifications, legal entity creation and servers. If we'd do a better research, we could get a lot of these tools for free or at least cheaper.
9. **No energy for marketing after launch:**
   * We spent so much time and energy developing the product that by the time we launched, we were exhausted and demotivated.
   * Marketing is critical at launch, but we didn‚Äôt have the energy to start when it mattered most.
10. **Underestimating the importance of networking:**

   * We didn‚Äôt actively seek out mentors, advisors, or partnerships that could have guided us or opened doors.
   * Building connections with the people that are already in the industry might have helped us validate our idea and find early adopters.

**Key takeaways:**  
Balance your team. Keep your MVP simple. Talk to users early. Dedicate as much effort to marketing as you do to development, and don‚Äôt underestimate the power of networking.

saw so many different companies, and was thinking who get the most customers. there are so many strategies, but as from my observation it looks like the good landing page is still the best.

why?

imagine deciding to check product, go to their website, and it looks scammy, it is loading super slowly, and the main title is bs. 90% of people already dropped out. idk how it works for u, but i, and people that i talked with agree that if website looks modern, is fast and done properly, we check just because we are interested, and are more likely to check rest of the content and buy product.

Really curious to know what kind of app it is, are u able to share more?', '2x venture backed founder and former VC here. \n\nFirst, dont over rotate on your early revenue when it comes to VC.\n\nHere are things that matter much more:\n\n1. How big is your market? Is this an ""I could get to $1 billion in revenue"" kind of business? \n\nIf youre going after something huge like CRM then you need to grow at lightning speed because these tend to be winner take all markets. And VC is great for hyperscaling big winner take all markets. The whole VC engine is designed for this. The best firms have hiring networks to get you top talent and the best investors at those firms are awesome advisors because theyve seen the game so many times before. To. The. Fucking. Moon. Baby.\n\nIf you\'re going after a small or niche market. Then you might consider avoiding VC because it comes at a high cost. First, it comes with ""liquidation preference"" so if you were to raise $10M, but then struggle and decide to sell the business for $10M or under, youd walk away with $0. Investors holding ""preferred shares"" get paid back first.\n\nThe other risk is interpersonal. If the market is too small, you might get a ton of pressure from your investor (especially if they take a board seat) to try to expand into another bigger market. Which could be wise or could be a big distraction.\n\nAnd lastly, the whole point of raising money is to scale up ahead of where you are. Which means youre going to jack up your burn rate. If the market opportunity isnt there youre going to find yourself upside down burning a ton, stressing the fuck out, and walking away with $0.\n\nThink of VC kind of like a loan, but with 40% APR. Taking it means you believe you can far outpace that APR with a faster revenue growth rate for every single year youre a privately held independent company. \n\nIf you can, dont hesitate.  Grab the money and run.\n\nIf you can\'t.  Step away from that treadmill.\n\n2. Do you have a strong enough technical team?\n\n2021 is over. VCs got their wits back. Lots of companies collapsed. Lots of VCs collapsed. \n\nAll the smart money is back to basics. And other than the above market point, people are paying attention the quality of the technical team again. ESPECIALLY in AI.\n\nWhy? Because strong technical teams build things others cant, and that means barriers to entry and competitve advantage. Why is OpenAI generating so much revenue? Because they dont yet have credible competition to chatgpt. \n\nBut if you\'re just a few hackers slinging a low code solution that just wraps gpt-4o with a novel use case then youre going to wake up with tons of competitors the moment people realize theres a market here. Look whats happened to the AI Writing space or the Sales AI space.\n\nHard to defend price in a crowded market and if you cant command a high price then the market opportunity shrinks. Also. avg transaction sizes drop making hyperscaling revenue so much harder because now you need high volume of purchases and also a lower CAC. Thats really really hard.\n\nBut if you do have a baller technical team... oh, my. Raising money will be a cake walk.

I avoid the interview styled questions at all costs because it has the tendency to make things awkward. I also do this thing where I will give 2-3 direct (but in a very diplomatic manner) comments on a previous project they've worked on or an opinion they have. This serves to see if my potential co-founder can work with me when shit hits the fan where direct, honest and no bs conversations need to held. Other than that, things I look for:      \n  \n\\- Communication style. Is he/she/they coherent and able to articulate well. This is crucial when speaking to VCs or customers   \n\\- Analytical abilities. There are simply too many people wanting to have a startup and they get too blinded by their ideas.

Because if they don't, customers will and that's going to be really brutal.    \n\\- A bit of a funny one: I want my co-founder to challenge me, no matter how uncomfortable that makes me feel.

He was asking me questions and giving me his thoughts, some of which were very direct (Your marketing plan is too broad - your product needs to be refined as it's all over the place - you sound like you're forcing AI into your product for the sake of AI which makes you look very desperate to me). It was the most refreshing conversation I've ever had since I started looking for a co-founder, not to mention he's making me think a bit more deeper...all from one conversation. I'm now doing everything I can (speeding up my validation, fast-tracking my MVP purely on my own, executing a marketing plan in a week) to convince him to join me.

I didn\'t know him before.\n* I had a cofounder that I thought was the most amazing person ever and just loved being with her and it was so energising.\n\nThe thing is that you want to have a cofounder that is skilled at what you are not. So by definition, you shouldn\'t be able to interview them, at least on what you aren\'t. \n\nOf course, you can interview them, but it\'s not about the qu, per se. \n\n* Do they make you feel dumb by how much they know?

Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

I'm setting up a monthly subscription service (selling services) where most of my clients would be in the U.S. For this, I thought about using Stripe, as it's well-known and inspires a lot of trust among Americans, but they don't operate in Argentina (Where I'm from and pay taxes from). You can set up an LLC and open a bank account in the U.S. to use Stripe that way, but I was advised that this could be complicated and costly (it ends up getting a good part of your earnings if you're not making a lot of money).

I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

Consistent and high MRR is extremely attractive to investors.', 'What are the alternatives for SaaS B2B or B2C businesses? Obviously depends on the market but generally speaking..', 'I\'ll take the contra here, as I strongly believe most consumer software should be subscription based.  The subscription model is a rational response to the unwillingness of consumers in general to pay what something is worth, as well as to pay for ongoing maintenance of it.  It\'s also a rational way to reduce the risk to the consumer of overpaying for something that\'s not that great.  It also helps align incentives, because the developer has to continually earn the business of their customers for them not to churn, and the customer has to continue to pay to use something if they want to keep getting value from it.\n\nAs an example, if you build a piece of software that requires let\'s say an android developer, an ios developer, and a back-end server engineer at an absolute minimum, and you assume some overhead costs such as customer support, legal, server hosting, and so on, and it takes a year to build this nice piece of software, you\'re talking about something like $1M in gross revenues, which is $700k after Apple and Google get their cut, to pay for those labor costs and make a modest profit.\n\nIf you price this on a one-time, fixed-cost basis, you have to contend with the upper limit of what people are going to pay you.  If you price it at $79.99 or $49.99, no one is goign to buy it, because very few people pay that much for anything software that\'s not, like, Microsoft Office or something.  If you price it at $9.99, you have to sell a lot of copies to break even.  Let\'s say you price it at $20, and you sell 50,000 units, and your math works out ok.\n\nExcept it doesn\'t, because it takes you 6-9 months to sell those units, and during that time, you\'ve had to keep those engineers on to fix bugs and deal with customer support issues and update the sdk\'s to the latest versions and so on.  And, you\'ve probably realized by now, I didn\'t include advertising costs above.  So now you have to get to 100,000 unit sales to come out ahead of all that.  At $20/unit, that is no easy feat.  Especially since everyone you\'ve sold it to has perpetual support needs and expectations, but isn\'t going to want to give you another dollar for an ""upgrade"" that feels like a money-grab.  And you will be incentivized to get more money from them because of the above dynamics, so you\'ll be adverse to them.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose you charge $5/month for this lovely piece of software.  A whole bunch more people are willing to try it out, because that\'s not a lot of money.  Some of those people will abandon the product because they don\'t like it.  Many will retain who do.  Some of the people are going to like it so much, they\'ll upgrade to the $45 annual plan to save money, but lock in revenue (and cash) for you in so doing.  You will be learning from this activity as to what features your most valuable customers value.  You will be learning your churn rates, and ultimately what the lifetime value of your customers is.   You can use this information to set your marketing budget more efficiently. And instead of thinking of this as ""$2m to come out ahead"", you can think of this as $100k a month in running costs (gross), to be making a margin.  That is 20,000 subscribers at $5 a month -- a much easier number to obtain. It\'s also much easier to justify the ongoing support and maintenance needs of your paying customers, as well as investing in new features to surprise, delight, and keep them happy.\n\nThis is a no-brainer and idk why anyone who has ever actually built software would take a different position.\n\nEDIT:  To the OP, why don\'t you start offering to treat your therapy clients for their problems on a one-time-fee basis?

- They want the founders focused on long term value of the startup, not the salary.

- They want more of the investment to go into growing the company.

Most investors are either independently wealthy (from a previous exit) or are getting nice compensation from the VC firm.

There's no alignment there.

How about pay yourself a salary where you don\'t worry about your reasonable living expenses at all and are able to stay focused on the big bet: your company?

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d2d,1h24935,I ruined the succesful person I had become. How to get back on the horse? ,"Hi everyone.

It's often said, that what matters most is not the things you build **but the person you become.** I have destroyed this person.

I will try to make this as short as possible.

**Story (skip if you want)**  
I'm failing my startup that I have worked on for 3 years now, full time. We made a MVP, got an investment, and over the few years 2 more investments. We were 4 cofounders. As all other startups we had some problems, but generally did a pretty decent job - But the last year things just went down down down.

6 month ago I could see where we were heading, so instead of driving 180 miles/hours off the cliff we acted. I was the person most suited for the job, so all got dismissed except me. I geared things down and ran the startup for 6-8 months alone, hoping to find a solution. It was hard. We were hoping for some light at the end Q4, and even though we reach much higher than previous years, it's not enough - We will die in a few months.

I have already gotten my previous job back that can sufficiently provide for my private financial situation (house, wife, kids) and ALSO give me time to work on another startup if I want to. I can give details if asked. My former coworkers are far ahead of me in this field now, and this is also hard to see, but I knew the risk.

**The problem:**  
The thing is. I WAS an incredible person. My strength as a person was my self discipline. I always did the right and uncomfortable thing. Ate right, worked out, spend every waking hour building, early mornings, and it paid off greatly. I build some incredible things. I peaked very early. Too early.

And the last few years has really taken a toll. Im exhausted. I have learned ALOT in the past few years, and I want to apply them on my new startup but i'm not getting anywhere, because my actions doesn't match my plans/words.

Let me give you one final piece of the puzzle. When I build my persona with incredible self discipline and skills, I read maybe 170 self discipline/help/business books. Now I can't find anything that inspires me, and because I have already read almost everything, i'm not getting excited and pumped by anything. I reread them alot, but they does nothing for me. Even ""No Excuses"" by Brian Tracy, that was my bread and butter is worthless for me.

Last note: I know when I write exhausted, every one will say: Take a break. But I dont know if I want that either. I want to make up for the lost years. I want back on the horse asap.

It's mentally and physically so hard to fail after you've given everything. Never the less, that's the risk.

**How do I get back on the horse when i'm not getting pumped by anything? My ""why"" is gone..**

**Update:**  
1st of all, i'm surprised by all the great answers. You are all awesome. It helps ALOT, and I feel blessed for all the insights.   
**What I'm doing now:** I'm taking a short break. But I've pretty certain that I will be digging myself a much bigger hole if I relax too long. So I will use the good days to move myself and my new ideas/business forward, and accept the bad days and relax.  As practical stuff i'm removing my phone for 30 days. I've learned som really toxic behaviors by checking emails constantly etc. I will also read even more (just started ""Switch"", recommended from this post). We've always said that we're a product of the 5 persons we most associate with, but in this same aspect I would rephrase this to: We are the product of the content we consume daily. And I have a few that has to go, if I want to move forward from this. It's important that I consume the right content now or else consume nothing. I'm restarting my gratitude journaling and joined fitness. This was previously a way for me to mentally refocus my brain and goals. And lastly: I will not push forward right now. From your advice i'm pretty certain I will feel it when I'm ""allowed"" to push again. I suspect it wont take very long. Thanks to everyone who helped. Lets do this.

When you stop working for a while, maybe something completely new will come to you. Maybe it will be a small project that will ignite that joy of creation in you. Or maybe something else - something you don't even think about now, because your head is too tired to notice it. For me, this approach has been giving me a lot of peace and inspiration lately. And I don't feel that I'm standing still. On the contrary, I feel like I'm starting to see more for the first time in a long time.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e82,1gr85fg,Creating a prototype ,"I‚Äôm a founder of a pre-seed company. I‚Äôve designed a basic medical device which I‚Äôve patented and through some networking, ended up speaking to a pretty influential fund who basically liked it a lot but said I need a prototype (at the moment I‚Äôve got renders, I‚Äôm in healthcare  (doctor) but not an engineer).

How do I go about building my device, I know it‚Äôs a broad question but just some direction would be helpful, I‚Äôm a quick learner and I know how to code - I‚Äôve heard a lot about Arduino - the fund basically said it doesn‚Äôt even have to be the right size, just show you‚Äôve built a prototype and then funding will be there. Long term I‚Äôm going to hire engineers and software developers but for the prototype I want to build it myself as I reckon the operational knowledge I‚Äôd get from the endeavour would be invaluable! 

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!! Feel like I‚Äôve got a great opportunity as long as I can capitalise on it!

* Get personalized recommendations rather than upvotes &amp; more...

He‚Äôs a super understanding, hardworking, and Ivy League-educated guy‚Äîbrilliant, to say the least. He came up with the idea for our startup, approached me through YC Cofounder Matching, and I agreed to partner with him. He‚Äôs been so patient with me, especially during times when my performance was inconsistent, or my motivation fluctuated. Honestly, I feel really lucky to have worked with him.



We had an equal equity split, and he was the one putting in the funds. I had promised to contribute my share but haven‚Äôt followed through yet. Despite that, he never pressured me or made me feel bad about it.



A few weeks ago, I was in a bad mental space and decided to take an unplanned three-week leave for my mental health. When I told him, he was incredibly supportive and said he was glad I was prioritizing myself. During that time, I had to miss some critical client meetings, which he handled on his own.



When I returned, he called a brief meeting and told me he had decided to step down and leave the company. He even said he didn‚Äôt mind surrendering his equity. He explained that this was the right choice for his mental health, expressed his respect for me, and offered to support the transition in any way to ensure my success. However, he refused to elaborate further on his reasons.

Tutorials, relatable memes, and challenges are great ways to show personality and reach your audience naturally without a hard sell.\n5. **Use Friendly Language, Not Corporate Speak:** Kids are more likely to engage if they feel they\'re talking to a real person, not a brand.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e6c,1grrb1f,I thought I‚Äôd share a few things that might cheer you up.,"After graduating from college, my two best friends and I started a service-based startup. We have developed many websites, mobile apps, and AI projects to help companies solve their customer-related problems.

From the beginning, instead of just solving others‚Äô problems, we wanted to work on something that truly mattered to us. We tried a lot of different ideas, but none of them took off. After a series of failures, we were fortunate enough to realize that every successful entrepreneur has something in common: the problems they solve are personal to them. I‚Äôm not saying this applies to everyone, but when you deeply analyze, you could see something.

EX : Shopify 
Tobias L√ºtke wanted to sell snowboarding gear online but was frustrated with the existing e-commerce solutions. So, he built Shopify to solve his own problem. Soon, others facing the same challenges started using Shopify, and that‚Äôs how it turned into a successful business.

Ex: Google
There were 5 search engines before Google. None of them were addressing the key problems of the users. The average query takes around 2-3 hours and showing totally irrelevant results. So Sergey and Larry both faced the same problem and wanted to come up with a solution. Initially, they built it for them. After some time many people have started using it. That‚Äôs the birth of Google. 

Ex: Facebook 
Facebook‚Äôs initial idea was to create an online directory for Harvard students, allowing them to connect and share information. Mark Zuckerberg was inspired by the existing concept of ‚Äúface books,‚Äù paper directories featuring student photos and basic details. He might have stopped if this project hadn‚Äôt been personal to him.

Ex: Stripe 
Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison. The idea came from their own frustrations with existing payment systems while building online businesses. They created a simple payment gateway that could be easily integrated into businesses without extensive setup or high fees. This, too, was a personal solution to a problem they faced.

There are countless examples like this, and the most exciting part is that we‚Äôre following the same path as these successful entrepreneurs took. 

The problem we faced was the lack of a reliable source for timely content outside of social media. But, social media has become increasingly toxic, filled with fake news, misinformation, and manipulated content.

So, we developed an app just for ourselves that satisfies  our needs. When my friends saw me using it, they wanted to download it too. That‚Äôs when we realized others might be facing the same problem. We invited friends to try it out, and, to our surprise, the app quickly grew to over 1,000 users, with 70% retention.

Scope Creep

The mother of all barriers to progress. Constantly adding new requirements will derail a project, sometimes indefinitely.

Set a clear plan from the start, and once finalized, freeze the scope to maintain focus and efficiency.

Do not accept scope changes unless the client is willing to pay for them and make sure they understand that the project timeframe will balloon depending on the amount of changes requested. 


Team Creep

Expanding the team unnecessarily adds complexity and confusion. We had clients that would demand to bring in their own product owners on the projects, which created huge headaches for our own dev team. 

Keep the team lean and purpose-driven for optimal collaboration, don‚Äôt let the client bully you (even if you really, really need them).


Death by Improvement 

It‚Äôs easy to fall into endless improvement cycles, chasing the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù product.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e2c,1gtuwc7,"Advice on data access agreements for MVP in a niche industry - options, key considerations","Hi there everyone

My partner and I are developing an online tool to aid decision-making in a specific industry. The tool processes vast amounts of data from a massive database, presenting clear and concise insights. To our knowledge, there‚Äôs nothing like it currently available for that industry.

Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at:

* We‚Äôre building an MVP using a smaller, manually created dataset to test the approach and gather feedback from trusted industry contacts.
* I have a solid understanding of the industry and its need for such a tool, while my partner (a programmer) has brought my idea to life technically.
* The large database that could truly unlock the tool‚Äôs potential is owned by a large nonprofit organisation.

Our main concern is figuring out how to approach this organisation. Neither of us has experience negotiating data access agreements, and we worry they might see our idea and develop their own solution.

One alternative we‚Äôve considered is starting with a similar, smaller organisation to test the tool with a live dataset and later approach the larger organisation with evidence of our tool's usefulness. However, this raises concerns:

1. The smaller market and less sophisticated user base may not fully benefit from the tool, limiting our proof of concept.
2. We risk someone else replicating the idea with the larger organisation while we focus on the smaller one, potentially losing our competitive edge.

I‚Äôd appreciate advice from anyone with experience negotiating data access agreements or navigating similar situations. What factors should we consider, and how can we protect our idea while forging partnerships?

Looking forward to your insights.

While these tactics may bring short-term results, they rarely build sustainable growth. Here‚Äôs why they hurt your brand and what to do instead.

# 1. Cheap Traffic Won‚Äôt Convert

Buying traffic or using clickbait might bring visitors, but they rarely turn into paying customers. Focus on attracting *qualified* leads who genuinely care about your offer.

# 2. SEO Shortcuts Aren‚Äôt Sustainable

Keyword stuffing and black-hat tactics might get you rankings temporarily, but they‚Äôll hurt your site long-term. Real SEO requires high-quality content, optimization, and relevant backlinks.

# 3. Over-Promoting on Social Media Turns Off Audiences

Social media should build relationships, not just promote products. Share valuable content, engage with your audience, and offer insights that build loyalty.

# 4. Google Ads Without Strategy Waste Money

Google Ads can burn through your budget if you don‚Äôt have a clear strategy. Focus on precise targeting and continuous optimization to get the best ROI.

# 5. Consistency is Key

Quick fixes lead to inconsistent messaging, confusing your audience. Stay consistent with your brand message and focus on solving your customers‚Äô problems.

# What Should You Do Instead?

* **Be Strategic**: Develop a marketing strategy with long-term goals.
* **Provide Real Value**: Deliver value through your content and service.
* **Track and Optimize**: Continuously measure and adjust your campaigns.

# Final Thought

Quick fixes may give temporary results, but true success comes from consistent, long-term strategies. Build relationships, offer real value, and focus on long-term growth.

We validated our idea with a few peers from our university programme that are trying to build a startup and seemed interested in our tool to analyze interviews properly.

# How Our Tool Works:

1. **Input Details**: You start by providing information about the problem, your potential solution, and your target audience.
2. **Generate Questions**: Our tool generates interview questions based on *The Mom Test* principles, helping you ask unbiased and meaningful questions.
3. **Conduct Interviews**: You then interview people in your target market using those questions.
4. **Analyze Audio Data**: After the interviews, you upload the audio, and our tool analyzes it. We use AI to identify patterns and insights, helping you determine if the problem is worth pursuing.

Our goal is to make the process of validating startup ideas more structured and data-driven, so you don‚Äôt end up building something that doesn‚Äôt solve a real need. Any feedback is more than welcome :) Cheers xd",3,startups,1731004656.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1glxlgo/tool_for_validating_demand_for_your_problem/,question,"['You can start by the old school method just do some crazy marketing around your product without even building it see how the market responds it may not be as much you want it to be then you can go around writing emails to folks you think can be your potential customers to gain insights if they would want to use you service another way would be to just build an MVP and get people to use to see how to respond', 'Have you validated this idea x)))))']"
67558dcceeb7770cf0a37ea5,1gq1dpy,How to know if your cofounder isn't pulling their weight?,"I've been working on a startup as a technical founder focused on product initially. I reached out and tried recruiting cofounders but didn't find the right fit until around April when I met a potential CTO/technical founder. We hit it off and he got involved and helped orchestrate some of our architecture, CI/CD, testing and authentication systems.

This was a big relief off my shoulders and helped focus more on the core product. Along the way I've collaborated with his responsibility areas to help him better integrate with our systems. But I knew his time and ability to contribute was limited to part-time. However initially I was pretty happy with his contributions. 

However lately I've realized the pace of his progress is stagnating or almost non-existent. I'm growing to question whether I should continue or just confront him to step up or step aside.

I expect some ups and downs but we have to consistently make significant progress on a monthly basis to get anywhere. I know if I keep looking I might find someone else and if I don't, I can be a solo founder. 

I guess I'm looking more for feedback or other people's experiences trying to work with other cofounders. My goal is to eventually split equity with him equally but we don't have any customers, just a product and we're bootstrapping with our own free time. 

How long of a grace period should you give a cofounder for issues? I'm not feeling any pressure right now since I've got time to get the product right. However I recently went to a convention and I'm eager to get our product stable and deployed so I can focus on selling it and delegate the management of operations/infrastructure to the cofounder or hire staff. 

I've already been working with my cousin also who is consulting as a developer and I realize she could largely shoulder many of his burdens if needed. She's familiar with the code and I could take over some of the cofounders roles until systems are mature and then delegate the maintenance and operations to her and hire more help as we get customers.",11,startups,1731461449.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gq1dpy/how_to_know_if_your_cofounder_isnt_pulling_their/,question,"['Sometimes you need to wait and see technically.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37f8c,1givx1n,How was your outsourcing experience? Could AI Revolutionize Software Outsourcing? Here‚Äôs What I‚Äôm thinking of,"**Hey founders/leaders!**

Let‚Äôs talk about software outsourcing‚Äîit‚Äôs often a nightmare, right? Founders everywhere vent about the headaches:

1. Finding a reliable developer or agency feels like searching for a unicorn.
2. Ambiguous project scopes and timelines lead to endless confusion and missed expectations.
3. Communication gaps turn into annoying, costly delays.
4. Code quality? Hit or miss. Often more miss than hit.
5. And let‚Äôs not forget: Budget drains. Up to 30% of costs vanish into inefficiencies and agency profits. Only a fraction truly goes to building your product.

**So, what if AI could change the game? ü§ñ‚ú® Here‚Äôs my vision:**

‚Ä¢ **There are still about 30% of work need to be done by human developers. Human developers write the code and deliver the solution! AI only helps to streamline the repetitive process.**

‚Ä¢ AI Project Manager: A 24/7 AI agent ready to assist. Need to create a task, tweak requirements, or check real-time status? Done. Instantly. Pricing and timelines at your fingertips‚Äîno waiting for a human manager to respond.

‚Ä¢ AI Engineering Manager: Automates code reviews, generates solutions, and tracks developer efficiency. This cuts waste, maximizing your budget on what matters: the actual development.

‚Ä¢ AI Technical PM: Keeps everything running smoothly, orchestrating the workflow step by step to minimize risks and avoid nasty surprises.

**Who‚Äôs this for?**

‚Ä¢ Founders launching MVPs and need speed.

‚Ä¢ Companies scaling and craving efficient dev teams.

‚Ä¢ Anyone sick of the hiring hassle, craving high-quality code without the drama.

In a nutshell: Think Upwork meets AI project management, but smarter.

So, what‚Äôs your take? Does this AI-powered approach hit the pain points you‚Äôve faced, or am I missing something crucial? Drop your thoughts‚ÄîI‚Äôm all ears!

I‚Äôm currently working on my pre-seed pitch deck and am grappling with whether or not to include TAM, SAM, and SOM estimates. While I understand these are often considered essential in investor decks, I‚Äôd love to better understand their relevance, especially at this early stage.

Here are some specific questions I‚Äôm struggling with:

2. Are there viable alternatives?a.

   * How can I ensure these numbers hold up to scrutiny without overpromising?

For instance:\n\nImagine you‚Äôre capable of handling 100 customers per month, and the average customer spends $100. That translates to 1,200 customers a year and $120,000 in annual revenue.

We‚Äôre living in the age of AI, and while it‚Äôs revolutionizing industries like healthcare and B2B finance, I can‚Äôt help but wonder: why isn‚Äôt anyone building AI tools for the everyday consumers, especially when it comes to managing our personal finances? ü§î

Why not a smart, personalized AI that connects securely to your financial data (your credit cards, bank accounts, etc.) and becomes your go-to financial assistant. You could ask it *anything*, like:

* **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best credit card for my dining expenses?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúHow much can I safely spend this month without touching my savings?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the quickest way to pay off my debt while maximizing my rewards?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúWhich insurance plan aligns with my lifestyle?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúAm I saving enough to buy my dream home in 5 years?‚Äù**

A NON JUDGEMENTAL FINANCIAL advisor available 24/7 who tailors advice *just for you*.

Here‚Äôs why I think this idea is exciting:

1. **AI + Your Data = Personalized Insights**: Instead of generic advice, it gives you actionable tips based on your actual spending, saving, and investment patterns.
2. **Empowering Decision-Making**: Whether you‚Äôre picking the best accounts, optimizing rewards, or planning for the future, it makes everything simpler and clearer.
3. **Bridging the Gap**: AI is thriving in B2B, but the consumer sector is being overlooked. Why not bring this game-changing tech directly to individuals?

I had a cool idea of doing a platform to connect students and startups for internship opportunities. I later larned that the market was very much saturated for it and i decided to refine the problem.

The plan was simple - make a very small prototype, show it to our professors, have them interested in it (as it was initially proposed as an idea by them) and then sell it to the university. 

We had a call with the professor today and she was, well.. not bought by our product. She mentioned that she doesnt think it adds that much value and ultimately that we should pivot - AGAIN.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ef9,1gn6url,A Non-Milestone,"I have been working on my idea for two years now. I started in 2022 with a market study to determine if my product would have the demand I thought it would. I only got 200 responses but it was something. I don't have a tech background so that was the biggest challenge I had to deal with.

  
I tried getting rough estimates from developers and got figures in the range of $80,000. No way I could afford that. Not only do I not have a net worth, but I don't even make anything capable of reaching that if I saved for a decade.

  
So I came to Reddit and sought a cofounder. Many guys in my country's subreddit wanted a paying client rather than a cofounder. They weren't what I was looking for. But I was lucky, I found a very nice cofounder who agreed to come on board and work with me on the idea. This guy doesn't even realize how much it meant to have someone believe in my idea.

Anyway, it has been nearly 8 months now since he came on board. I was contemplating going back to medical school but I realized this idea was my passion. I am not very social but for the first time, I know I will knock on doors every day, every night, all year until I get the funding to go to market.  
  
He says he's making great progress towards the MVP. Now the goal has shifted. I thought getting an MVP was the greater challenge I would face, but we got through that. Now I move on to seeking $600,000 in funding and the subsequent licences. And I have never been so motivated to go for anything. Never have I been so sure that I will overcome my anxiety, my fear of failure, and disappointment to make sure I get this done.

My cofounder may not realize it but he got me through the biggest milestone I thought I had to face. To him, it is a non-milestone because he was just doing stuff he loves to do.

It makes me wish I became an engineer or learned how to code to solve these crazy ideas like going to the moon. My touch of the tism didn‚Äôt do well in a school setting and I feel like I never actually learned because of it. 

That being said, I have a 6 year old son now and watching him learn things is incredible, it amazes me how smart kids are. And I think he would love to learn how to use a computer or code or get past complex problems. 

That leads me to this post, I have an older laptop that I don‚Äôt use and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows of some sort of program for kids. In my head I am imaging like a new system, when you open the laptop it starts with a very simple thing, like showing a picture of the f key, and once you push that it gives another task.

Stone cold. Zero prior relationship. At massive scale (with AI).

And I was skeptical. But guess what? It works.

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I‚Äôve learnt a ton so far that‚Äôs helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don‚Äôt rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e28,1gtzri9,"Co-Founder Conflict and Missed Targets in Our Startup:  What Should I Do ?
","I am the co-founder of a ticketing platform (SaaS &amp; marketplace) based in Africa. My CTO and I started this journey in 2022, aiming to solve a major market problem in the events industry in Africa. Our vision was clear: create a platform that simplifies ticketing and access control while offering an accessible marketplace for event organizers and attendees. Initially, I approached him to hire him for system development, but he proposed we partner instead. Believing in his technical expertise and passion for the vision, I agreed, and we started the business with a shareholding structure of 65% (me) and 35% (CTO).

At the start, we shared a mutual enthusiasm for the project, but over time, our visions for the business began to diverge. These differences have gradually led to conflicts regarding the goals, target market, and overall approach to running the business. Our business development efforts and system development processes have become completely disintegrated. What‚Äôs more, I‚Äôve found myself increasingly excluded from the technical side of things. Despite my repeated efforts to be kept in the loop about development progress, my CTO continues to operate in isolation, leaving me in the dark.

When we initially launched the partnership, we agreed to use the lean methodology. Our goal was to launch an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within 2022 to quickly gather user feedback and iterate based on market needs. However, we only managed to release a basic system for managing access control and generating hardcopy tickets‚Äîand this didn‚Äôt happen until 2023. I felt this was an unnecessary delay, as the initial scope of work was straightforward.

By early 2024, my CTO admitted that the workload was overwhelming, and we decided to hire additional help. We brought on board one developer and an intern, thinking this would ease the burden and accelerate progress. We set a three-month target to release V1 of the platform, with clear priorities and a defined scope. However, my CTO continued to add features outside the agreed scope, causing significant delays. As of today, we have yet to launch anything meaningful. In total, this means we‚Äôve failed to launch a functional product since 2022‚Äîa reality that is increasingly disheartening for me as a co-founder.

To make matters worse, my CTO frequently takes on side gigs, often working with the same developer we hired to help with our project ( They are all on salary ). While I understand the need for financial stability in a bootstrapped startup, this directly impacts our progress and focus. Missing deadlines has become the norm, and the lack of accountability has led to lost opportunities. Some of our existing clients have even begun moving to competitors because our offerings remain limited. This is incredibly frustrating, as I‚Äôve made multiple attempts to address the issue by discussing how the lack of communication and missed deadlines affect the business. Unfortunately, these discussions haven‚Äôt brought about any meaningful changes.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that we don‚Äôt have any formal agreements beyond the company incorporation documents. We never established detailed operational agreements or governance structures to guide decision-making or accountability. While this may have been fine in the beginning, it has now become a glaring issue as conflicts arise. Looking back, I take responsibility for not pushing harder to formalize regular meetings and progress reviews. Without these, it‚Äôs been difficult to align on priorities and address concerns effectively.

We are also operating from a rented flat, which serves as both our workplace and living space. This arrangement, paid for through company funds, initially seemed cost-effective but has contributed to blurring the lines between work and personal boundaries. It has also made it harder to separate professional disagreements from personal conflicts, further complicating the partnership.

For context, I‚Äôve put everything into this business. From May 2022 until August 2024, I worked tirelessly‚Äîoften 15-hour days without a single day off and without taking a salary. I only started drawing a salary in April 2024, but even then, I‚Äôve kept it minimal to keep our expenses manageable. My motivation has always been the belief that we‚Äôre solving an important market problem, particularly in Africa‚Äôs events industry. However, as the time go by and progress remains stagnant, I‚Äôm starting to doubt whether we have the right team to execute this vision. I‚Äôm questioning whether it‚Äôs time to make some hard decisions for the sake of my own well-being and the future of the business.

Currently, I‚Äôm considering two options:

Option 1: Fire My CTO

One option is to terminate my CTO‚Äôs involvement in the business. While this might seem like the most straightforward solution, it‚Äôs not without significant risks. My CTO has been the technical lead from the start, and his removal would likely create a power vacuum and disrupt the already fragile development process. Given that we‚Äôre a small team, losing him would set us back significantly in terms of product development. Additionally, firing him could escalate tensions and lead to legal disputes, albeit with differing shareholding percentages.

On the other hand, his continued involvement is hindering progress. His lack of accountability and focus is directly impacting our ability to meet targets and grow the business. If I were to replace him, I would need to find a technical lead who not only understands our current development status but also aligns with the vision of the business. This would take time and resources‚Äîboth of which are already stretched thin. The question remains: would firing him ultimately save the business or push us further into chaos?

Option 2: Let the Business Fail

The second option is to accept that we‚Äôre not the right team to execute this vision and allow the business to fail. This would involve letting the partnership dissolve naturally, either through mutual agreement or as a result of financial constraints. While this is not the outcome I want, it might be the most realistic one given the current circumstances. If the business were to collapse, I could take the lessons I‚Äôve learned from this partnership and apply them to future projects. I‚Äôd also consider picking up the parts of the business that still have potential in the African market, such as the ticketing and access control systems.

However, letting the business fail comes with its own set of challenges. We‚Äôve already invested significant time, effort, and resources into this project. Walking away now would feel like giving up on something that has the potential to succeed with the right execution. It would also mean leaving behind the clients and partners who have placed their trust in us. Moreover, there‚Äôs the emotional toll of watching something I‚Äôve poured my heart into come to an end.

My Current Reflection

As I reflect on these two options, I can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of failure. I started this journey with so much enthusiasm and belief in the impact we could make. For the first two years, I was highly motivated, working long hours without compensation because I believed in the vision. But now, that motivation is waning as the reality of our disorganization and lack of alignment becomes more apparent.

I also recognize my own shortcomings in this situation. For instance, I should have pushed harder for formal agreements and regular meetings to ensure transparency and accountability. I also should have addressed the issue of side gigs earlier, as this has clearly impacted our ability to meet targets. While it‚Äôs easy to place blame on my CTO, I know that I share responsibility for some of the challenges we‚Äôre facing.

At this point, I‚Äôm seeking advice from those who have faced similar situations. What would you do in my position? Is it worth salvaging this partnership and trying to realign our efforts, or is it time to cut my losses and move on? Are there other options I haven‚Äôt considered that could help us get back on track?

You might want this too, to keep the strategics honest on pricing and on their behavior generally.  \n\nWith strategics, a change in strategy or the departure of your champion can really screw with their willingness to continue supporting you. Also, the amount of money they will be putting into you is an easier writeoff if there is a strategy shift or just a lack of appetite and/or budget to continue backing you.  A strategic might also want to optimize for option value and try to buy you for cheap, whereas a VC will be aligned to the biggest possible outcome.\n\nWhy not leverage this investment to get an institutional round together?

I think this is a nod of confidence in your product coming from a strategic and that's likely how institutional VCs will see it. No real downsides in my opinion. Strategics typically make such early investments in products they like (and see as an acquisition targets) so that they can remain close to the business and the founders. That of course doesn't mean you have to agree to their acquisition overtures down the road. Having the strategic on your cap table will be a strong endorsement when going out to more institutional funds. Something to consider is protecting your secret sauce.

* Generate screens based on prompts.
* Let you create designs for an entire application by giving high-level prompts for the whole flow.
* Allow you to refine or iterate on the designs using additional prompts.

Have you tried anything like this? Or maybe you‚Äôve stumbled across some cool tools but haven‚Äôt had the chance to try them yet?

Also, if you‚Äôre using something, how much more productive do you feel when working with it? Does it save you tons of time, or is it more of a fun experimental thing?
