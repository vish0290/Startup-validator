There has been a lot of changes in techstars over past few years and a lot of good people have stayed but a lot of really amazing people have departed as well. We are in the position of accepting their offer but not sure how the program will be.

Little bit about us: One FAANG + One ivy - both devs with 7 yoe building open source dev tool for agent infra.  
We have interviewed with YC + all others accelerators in past + in touch with Skydeck's managing partner and they have spoken to us in a way that kind of looks promising. (they said we were very close to making it in the last cohort and we are making progress in right direction and they are excited about what we are building + really like the team but need traction).

6799340e3474f2d0be95d138,1ic72za,Building in the open with Founder University - I will not promote,"**Published Oct 30, 2024** 

I am on my fifth startup.

I ran the last one for a decade, that’s a whole story. A hell of a story. But a different story. I’ll tell it to you when I can, but not right now.

The one before that was an e-commerce site that did pretty well but I didn’t love it. Before that were two service businesses. The first one I did for the love of the game, the second one was an attempt to make people stop asking me to fix their computer by charging them outrageous prices, which backfired horribly when they were eager to pay. None are relevant except to say I’ve been around the block and have the scars to prove it.

When it was time to get back out there, I wanted to use all I’ve learned to do better. Before I talk about what those lessons produced, I’m going to talk about what those lessons were. Cause before effect, after all.

One thing I wanted to do better this time was pattern matching - making the startup look the way that the industry and investors “expect” a startup to look. My last startup was an awesome idea with awesome tech (still is, but like I said, another story), but that one didn’t match patterns. It didn’t match investor patterns, industry buying patterns, patterns of existing, immediate, recognized and admitted needs. Because it didn’t “look” right to anyone, everything about it was way harder than necessary.

The “make it look right” approach runs the risk of building a cargo cult, imitating the trappings of something but without understanding the essence of that something, but then again, a thing that looks like a knife is going to make a better knife that a thing that looks like a bowling ball, so sometimes just sharing apparent similarities can get you pretty far, even if it doesn’t get you all the way there. Like how mimicking someone’s accent makes it easier for them to understand you.

For this one, I wanted to adopt every tool, method, and pattern that I knew “the industry” wanted to see to minimize the friction from development, go-to-market, scaling, adoption, and that would make investment optional (and, therefore, available if desired) instead of necessary (and, therefore, largely unavailable).

That required establishing some expectations for successful patterns I could match against.

## What patterns am I matching to?
Here’s a general sketch of my pattern matching thought process:

1. Software first and software only. It’s the easiest industry to start a business in, lowest startup costs, and easiest customer acquisition.

2. I wanted to build software for an element of the industry that’s actively emerging (and therefore has room to grow) and part of an optimistic investor thesis (and therefore has a cohort of people who are intent on injecting capital into the market to help it grow).

3. It needs to fills a niche that is underexplored (low competition) and highly potent (lots of opportunity), while being aligned to recognized and emerging needs within the industry (readily adopted).

4. I wanted it to have evidence supporting the business thesis that proves the demand exists, but demonstrates that the demand is unanswered (as of yet) by sufficient or adequate supply.*

5. I wanted the lowest number of dominoes to line up and tip for everything to work correctly - the more dominoes in the line, the less likely the last one will fall.

6. I wanted to implement modern toolsets for everything, wherever possible.

7. I wanted to obey the maxim, “When there’s a gold rush, don’t mine the gold, sell the picks and shovels.”

8. Whatever I chose would need to produce cash flow almost immediately with minimal development time or go-to-market delays, because the end of ZIRP killed the “trust me bro” investment thesis predominant over the last 15 years.

9. I wanted to match to YC best practices, not because YC can predict what will definitely work, but because they’ve churned through so many startups in the last 15 years that they have a good sense of what will definitely not work.

10. And I wanted to build client-centric, because if my intent is to to produce cash flow immediately, we need to get clients immediately, and if we need to get clients immediately, we need to focus on what clients need right now.

Extra credit: What’s the difference between a customer and a client?

Note: Competition is awesome! Competition is validating and not scary, because competition proves a market exists. But competition, especially mature competition against an immature startup, makes it harder to break into a space. A first mover advantage isn’t everything, but seeing demand before it’s sufficiently supplied is a great advantage if you’re capital constrained or otherwise unproven. Think about how much money the first guy to sell fidget spinners or Silly Bandz made versus how much money the last guy to order a pallet of each made. Finding demand that exists already but is as of yet insufficiently satisfied is a great place to start.

## What opportunity spaces are most relevant?
The industries and markets I chose to observe were:

* AI, because if I’m following a theme &amp; pattern for today, it’s AI.

* Fintech, because cash is king, and fintech puts your hands on cash flow.

* Crypto/blockchain, because that’s the “new” fintech (or maybe the “old-new” fintech?), and crypto creates powerful incentives and capital formation strategies, along with a lot of flexibility for transaction systems.

* Tools, particularly unmet demand in tools, that enable these industries.

If you wanted to do some brief and simple homework, you could map each of those bullets to several of the numbered list items preceding them.

The reasoning was pretty simplistic - AI is what people want to build and invest in now, while fintech and crypto/blockchain are what people were building and investing in for the last major investment thesis. That means that there’s demand in the market for AI and AI-adjacent startups, while there’s a glut of underutilized and highly developed tools within fintech and crypto/blockchain, with a lot of motivated capital behind the adoption. When someone is thinking “I built this thing and not enough people are using it”, and you then build something that uses it creates a great way to find allies.

This rationale harnesses technology that is being built and financed now (which means it needs tools and support methods, and a lot of other “picks and shovels”), while leveraging technology that was recently built and financed and is eager for more widespread adoption of the existing toolkits, which makes it suitable for using to build the AI-adjacent tools that are in demand now. It’s like two harmonics producing constructive interference - it makes two waves into one larger wave, which gives me more momentum to surf against.

This was a learning process, and I iterated against my general paradigm repeatedly as I learned more. Neither of us have the patience to go through that in excruciating detail, so I’ll cover the highlights in my next post.

Extra credit answer: A customer gets a product, a client gets a service.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d13f,1ic1lm8,"I spent 30 years as Founder not taking the ""safe route"" - Here's why I don't regret it. (I will not promote)","I've been a startup Founder since 1994 when I started my first company at 19.  Since then I've started 9 companies and exited 5.  The last exit was last year.  I'm trying to provide some backstory without getting into who I am - you can dig into that on your own if you want, but it's not necessary.

 I wanted to share what a life looks like when every time you can choose between ""The Safe Route"" and the ""Totally Stupid Idea"" ... you always pick the latter.  I think part of this is because we all struggle with the ""What if..."" and often romanticize that outcome.  

 Here are some milestones where I had to make those choices, what I did, and how it turned out.  Some of you are dealing with exactly these choices, so I want to provide some color from one point of view on how I thought about it.

 1. I dropped out of college  

Look, I sucked as a student, which is kind of ironic bc I'm basically paid to be a teacher. When I was 19, in 1994 I realized that this new thing called ""The Internet"" would be a big deal and I could charge companies money to build something called a ""Web Site"".  When I told my guidance counselor that I was dropping out of school to start ""an Internet company"" she looked at my incredulously and said ""What's the Internet?!"" 

 Needless to say she wasn't supportive of my decision.  Nor was any other person in my life whatsoever.  You have to remember that back then the idea of young Founders wasn't anything like it is today.  I had no idea if this interactive agency thing had legs, I just knew that I hated school and was essentially unemployable.  So I went all in.  

 The reason I think it worked isn't because the agency went on to be successful.  It worked because I knew in my gut that working for someone else, or more specifically not having complete agency of my life (no matter what it paid) was all I really cared about.  That ended up being the defining characteristic of my life thereafter.  It was immutable, even though every voice around me told me otherwise.

 2. I left my own company before IPO

 The agency I started go merged with another agency, I joined the board and served as the CEO of the interactive part and we grew that company to $700m in billings in 7 years.  At that point we were prepping for an IPO.  In 2001 we were approached by Dan Snyder (yes the Washington Commanders owner) to purchase the agency and we sold it in 2002 with the understanding that we'd take it public past the sale.  

 At that point I had the option of working at the agency and going through the IPO or leaving altogether.  I quit well before any of that happened.  Why?  I hated working at an agency.  It pays well, but service work is insanely thankless (if you do well, no one cares, if you fuck up, clients are all up your ass) and we were working with clients that paid well, but didn't inspire me.  I was 27.

 I left a LOT of money on the table.  My business partner stayed on, took the company IPO, and made gobs of cash.  What he endured to get it was insane, and I respect him so much.  In the 20+ years since I have spent about 9 seconds worrying about whether or not I made the right decision.  

 I would have made more money, but I would have eaten up some of the most exciting years of my life (late 20s, early 30s) slaving for clients I didn't enjoy with a mission I simply didn't care about (btw, that's also unfair to everyone I worked with).  I valued my freedom over the money, and looking back I realize it was an incredible win for my life, not so much my wallet ;)

 3. I clashed with VCs over running my company

 This has a lot more backstory than I can offer here, but the short version is I seed funded my first (funded) startup with a bunch of well known backers like Bessemer, Founder's Fund, and notably in this case Mark Suster (before he became a VC, he personally invested).  Mark was very adamant when we started the company (same concept as what Affirm is now, only years before them) that I only focus on this one thing, and nothing else.

 He said that what good Founders do is focus on a single, funded opportunity and just pursue that.  Did I follow Mark's advice?  No - I did pretty much the opposite.  Instead I started 4 other companies, 2 of which I self-funded and 2 of which I venture funded.  It... did not go well with investors.

 VCs are very used to have a large degree of control over their funded Founders and with me, they had none of this, and it really pissed them off.  To be clear - that was MY fault, not theirs.  I was kind, but I really don't like being told what to do (hence my career choice).  

 Because of that, and other reasons, we had very ""meh"" outcomes on all of the funded companies.  No big losses, but no big wins.  It was 100% my fault.  Maybe had I focused on just one company like Mark said, it would have been more successful.  Maybe not.  

 But my goal was to build a portfolio of startups, because I wanted the agency to work on lots of things in parallel because that's where my heart and interest lies.  What I learned from that experience, which actually helped me, was that I could still pursue that path (what I'm doing now) but I'd have to do it without investors.  

 It's kind hard to be in the startup game and not wonder whether or not we should have pursued investment.  So I took both paths (some funded, some not) at the same time for over a decade (I would highly recommend this to no one) and learned through tears and panic attacks, that being a funded founder isn't for me.  

 ... well, this got way longer than I expected so hopefully there are a few parallels that some of you can pull from this.  

Happy to dig in on any of those points and expand a bit.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d140,1ic13mb,Should I give up my Idea ? [ I will not promote],"**Hey everyone,**

I had this startup idea for an app to improve communication in dental offices. As a dentist myself, I’ve often faced the problem of inefficient communication when an instrument is missing during treatment. That’s when I came up with the idea of a **push-to-talk communication app**, which could also be used with a **foot pedal** for more hygienic interaction. The concept is to allow hygienic and efficient communication with the assistance team outside the room.

Before building an MVP, I wanted to validate the idea to see if my colleagues would find it useful. The colleagues I talked to were really enthusiastic about it, but I knew I had to be careful not to rely solely on biased opinions.

To get broader feedback, I created a **landing page** where people could learn about the idea and evaluate it. However, after 1 month and 10 days, unfortunately, nobody engaged with it as intended—nobody evaluated the idea.

To drive traffic, I set up an **Instagram page** and created some explanatory videos to share the concept and encourage people to visit the website. After a month, I gained **98 followers**, around **22 saves on posts**, and **over 100 likes in total**, but still, no one followed the CTA to evaluate the idea.

I’ve received a little feedback through Instagram, but it hasn’t been enough to truly validate the idea.

**Now I’m wondering: Should I give up on this idea and move on? How long should one even spend validating a startup idea?**

So I've been building a website for pickleball events for the last 13 months as a solo-founder, solo-developer (mostly) and solo-most everything else, and I'm hoping to grow a team to help scale this thing this year.

Here's what I've accomplished so far:  
\- The site averages about 1,000 weekly unique visitors. Its mostly focused on the outside-the-US market for now (admittedly I decided to forego placing ads on the site so there's no revenue so far... probably a mistake but its not too late to fix)

\- I'm very confident I've found a solid product-market fit, having done tons of Lean-startup-type work on validating the ideas I've had before building  
\- We're launching the first paid features for the site this coming weekend and I already have several customers lined up ready to post their events on my site. 

What I'm hoping to do this year is to bring on another developer to help with coding, someone to help with marketing/outreach to increase market share, and possibly look for a startup coach/mentor that I can meet with to discuss business things with. I want to stay on in a technical role, but maybe 70-30 split my time working the other aspects of the business I've been neglecting.  
  
I'm not quite sure how to do this the right way and hoping to get some advice from the community. I've been self-funding the project the entire time (so far have spent several $1k on hiring freelancers from Upwork to help with some of the coding), and I'm trying to build this while also staying at my full-time day job (I know, may become unrealistic, but I'm trying...). The funding I had set aside for the project has run out and I feel like my only option is to offer equity. 

At this stage is equity my best option? I'm hesitant to explore VC funding for a few reasons. Will that even be able to attract anyone to join up?

I have a startup with the product ready and a few paying customers using it. I want to expand and raise funding and have a very clear roadmap of what I want to do with my product. However, I am not very familiar with fundraising as my startup is bootstrapped. I understand that I can try joining an accelerator and that might be a good approach but I also want to know if it would make sense to onboard someone who knows about fundraising and has experience in this to help with the process or is it best to do it on your own (or join an accelerator).

Some people in the sub might not agree but fuck it, I might have to give a few users use the product for free for 2-3 months so that it helps me keep iterating it. I know this is a bit L move, but I think I have these advantages:

1. Being in constant touch with the users, I will keep getting feedback and know what to do next.
2. At least I will not waste time in assuming most of the problems that need to be solved.

Having personally participated in two accelerators in the past - it was a critical lifeline in starting a company for the first time

I was suggesting a few programs to new founders and realized every accelerator list I can find is horrible.

**So I made a list with the key components:**

* Accelerator name and application link
* number of alumni companies
* Program leader (with LinkedIn link)
* Typical deal terms
* Program fee (irrespective of investment)
* Program length
* Cohorts/batches per year
* Company type focus (if any)
* Acceptance rate
* HQ location
* In person vs virtual
* Top 3 alumni
* number of exits

**Scoring system:** Then I applied a weighted average rating to score each program objectively and ranked them based on…

1. Investment terms
2. Top alumni/exits
3. % of companies who raised a next round
4. Quantity and prestige of their network
5. Misc (program fees, flexibility, etc)

**Observations:**

* some of the best programs are relatively new like Sequoia Arc, Speedrun, Disney Accelerator
* the best programs are free (top-25 are 3x more likely to have no fees or equity requirements for participating)
* better programs are transparent: top 50 were 4x more likely to share at least one of deal terms, alumni deal conversion, program fees
* CA is king: 48 programs were non-US based but 15 of the top 25 were based in CA
* YC is one of one

The thing is, I won't be continuing my startup for X reason. I should have waited some time before incorporating it, but it's too late to go back.

I want to keep the LLC, since I spent $400 incorporating it and like the name, and will maybe use it in the future. But for now, I don't want to keep spending $35 per month (a lot of money in my country) for the Mailroom address (Firstbase feature where they give you a physical address for mailing).



I reached out to them and they said this:

Failure to maintain an address could also result in your assets being frozen, your bank account being closed, and your company falling out of good standing with the state.**

Can I cancel Mailroom still? I don't want problems with the US/Wyoming obviously, but I literally never invoiced anything to this LLC (only $1 using Stripe for testing purposes).

# What's happening

Have had a huge 2.5 months learning to build and deploy my own web application from scratch. I've been reading a lot into best practices largely from this sub and from highly recommended documentation e.g. ""the mom test"".

Admittedly, I have over-engineered the website for a POC but in my gut I believe that people will not buy into the vision if the quality is embarrassing - For context: My product is healthcare-related and aimed at parents of children with special needs, therefore I want to come across as trustworthy and driven to parents. Also for what it's worth it has been an excellent learning experience.

I have been seeking feedback from the start but the target market is pretty niche and while I've had lots of great feedback from this sub, friends and family - I'm struggling to find ways to get in front of my ideal customers. Those I am in touch with are from my organic network, including the CEO of a related charity who genuinely loves the idea and is co-hosting a webinar for us to pitch the idea and try and attract some testers mid-Feb (great stuff).

# What's next?

I've decided that I will dedicate the month of February to locking down 5-10 testers for the app and I'm currently crunching ideas on how I can do this - Some plans I have:

* Contact more charities and parent support groups for collaborative purposes, try to get access to their network, offer to host webinars on how technology can assist special needs and then pitch the app at the end.
* Go to schools / special schools and leave flyers
* Dig into social media accounts e.g. instagram, twitter - get involved in conversations

# Sign off

I'll sign off saying that I'm feeling anxious and unstable at the moment but I know that's normal and part of the lifestyle.

[i will not promote]","https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/2025-will-likely-be-another-brutal-year-of-failed-startups-data-suggests/

[i will not promote]

More startups shut down in 2024 than the year prior, according to multiple sources, and that’s not really a surprise considering the insane number of companies that were funded in the crazy days of 2020 and 2021. 

It appears we’re not nearly done, and 2025 could be another brutal year of startups shutting down.

TechCrunch gathered data from several sources and found similar trends. In 2024, 966 startups shut down, compared to 769 in 2023, according to Carta. That’s a 25.6% increase. One note on methodology: Those numbers are for U.S.-based companies that were Carta customers and left Carta due to bankruptcy or dissolution. There are likely other shutdowns that wouldn’t be accounted for through Carta, estimates Peter Walker, Carta’s head of insights.

“Yes, shutdowns increased from 2023 to 2024 in every stage. But there were more companies funded (with bigger rounds) in 2020 and 2021. So we would expect shutdowns to increase just by nature of VC naturally,” he said. 

At the same time, Walker admitted that it’s “difficult” to estimate exactly how many more shutdowns there were, or will be. 

“I bet we’re missing a good chunk,” he told TechCrunch. “There are a number of companies who leave Carta without telling us why they left.”

Meanwhile, AngelList found that 2024 saw 364 startup winddowns, compared to 233 in 2023. That’s a 56.2% jump. However, AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli has a fairly optimistic take, noting that winddowns “are still very low relative to the number of companies that were funded across both years.”

Layoffs.fyi found a contradicting trend: 85 tech companies shut down in 2024, compared to 109 in 2023 and 58 in 2022. But as founder Roger Lee acknowledges, that data only includes publicly reported shutdowns “and therefore represents an underestimate.” Of those 2024 tech shutdowns, 81% were startups, while the rest were either public companies or previously acquired companies that were later shut down by their parent organizations.

VCs didn’t pick “winners”

So many companies got funded in 2020 and 2021 at heated valuations with famously thin diligence, that it’s only logical that up to three years later, an increasing number couldn’t raise more cash to fund their operations. Taking investment at too high of a valuation increases the risk such that investors won’t want to invest more unless business is growing extremely well. 

“The working hypothesis is that VCs as an asset class did not get better at picking winners in 2021. In fact, the hit rate may end up being worse that year since everything was so frenzied,” Walker said. “And if the hit rate on good companies remains flat and we fund a lot more companies, then you should expect many more shutdowns after a few years. And that’s where we are in 2024.”

Dori Yona, CEO and co-founder of SimpleClosure, a startup that aims to automate the shutdown process, believes that in 2021, we saw a large number of startups receiving seed funding “probably before they were ready.”

Merely getting that money may have set them up for failure, Yona explained.

“The rapid capital infusion sometimes encouraged high burn rates and growth-at-all-costs mentalities, leading to sustainability challenges as markets shifted post-pandemic,” he noted. As such, “in recent years, many high-profile companies ceased operations despite significant funding and early promise.”

The primary impetus behind the shutdowns is an obvious one.

“Running out of cash is typically the proximate cause,” Walker surmises. “But the underlying reasons are likely some combination of lack of product-market fit, lack of ability to get to cash-flow positive, and overvaluation leading to an inability to continue fundraising.”

Looking ahead, Walker also expects we’ll continue to see more shutdowns in the first half of 2025, and then a gradual decline for the rest of the year. 

That projection is based mostly on a time-lag estimate from the peak of funding, which he estimates was the first quarter of 2022 in most stages. So by the first quarter of 2025, “most companies will have either found a new path forward or had to make this difficult choice.”

AngelList’s Kohli agrees. “They’re not all washed out,” he said of the startups funded at unreasonably high valuations during those heady days. “Not even close.” 

Already this year, we’ve seen Pandion, a Washington-based delivery startup, announce it was shutting down. The company was founded during the pandemic and had raised about $125 million in equity over the last five years. And in December, proptech EasyKnock abruptly shut down. EasyKnock, a startup that billed itself as the first tech-enabled residential sale-leaseback provider, was founded in 2016 and had raised $455 million in funding from backers.

Startups dying across industries, stages 

The types of companies impacted last year were across a range of industries, and stages.

Carta’s data points to enterprise SaaS companies taking the biggest hit — making up 32% of shutdowns. Consumer followed at 11%; health tech at 9%; fintech at 8%, and biotech at 7%.

“Those percentages align pretty well with the initial funding to those sectors,” Walker said. “And essentially what this says is that every startup sector has seen shutdowns and none vastly outperformed, which gives support to the theory that the main cause of the increase is macro-economic, i.e. interest rate changes and the lack of available venture funding in 2023 and 2024.”

Layoffs.fyi’s much smaller subset found that finance accounted for 15% of the shutdowns with food (12%) and healthcare (11%) coming in second and third.

When it comes to stage, SimpleClosure’s data found that 74% of all shutdowns since 2023 are either pre-seed or seed, with the plurality (41%) at the seed stage.

Most startups tend to shut down when the coffers are completely dry, though some see the writing on the wall early enough to give a bit back to their investors.

“The majority of startups (60%) that fail don’t have enough capital left to return to investors,” Yona said. “Founders that do plan on returning funds have an average $630,000 of investments left — about 10% of total capital raised, on average.”

Yona also predicts the rate of startup closures will not slow down anytime soon.

“Tech zombies and a startup graveyard will continue to make headlines,” Yona said. “Despite the crop of new investments, there are a lot of companies that have raised at high valuations and without enough revenue.”",startups,1737991385.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ibbkrr/2025_will_likely_be_another_brutal_year_of_failed/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d154,1ib9kqx,The RDI Process: How to Find a Winning Startup Idea💡 (i will not promote),"So, you want to be a founder, huh? You’ve got the passion, the idea, and a few friends who think “pivot” is a cool business term. But how do you actually come up with a real idea that doesn’t flop harder than your last failed startup? Enter RDI – Research Driven Ideation.

It’s basically the grown-up version of, “I have an idea... but what’s the problem I’m solving?” (Yes, that’s important. Turns out, building a product that people actually need is a thing.)

Here’s how it works:

**Phase 1**: Get your team together. Talk about your goals. Set expectations. Have an awkward “what do we actually want to do here?” conversation. But seriously, figure out what you’re doing before jumping into the next shiny object.

**Phase 2:** Get really smart. You’re going to dive deep into one industry like you’re writing a dissertation on it. Create an “industry primer.” Basically, your cheat sheet for the whole space, so you don’t look clueless in real conversations. Example: If you’re tackling healthcare tech, your industry primer should answer: Who are the key players? What regulations are landmines? Where’s the $$$ flowing?

**Phase 3**: The fun part! Go out there and talk to experts, get your hands dirty, learn all the things that will help you figure out what’s actually wrong with the industry. I know, you're an introvert who just wants to code and nothing else, but trust me, this is where the magic happens. Get out of your comfort zone and start those conversations!

In short, RDI takes you from “I have an idea” to “I have a plan” without all the guesswork. So, if you’re tired of waiting for your genius idea to just magically appear, maybe it’s time to get serious and start researching your way to success. Or at least avoid your next big flop.",startups,1737986008.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ib9kqx/the_rdi_process_how_to_find_a_winning_startup/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d155,1ib95ms,Seeking Advice for Salary Negotiation in a Startup (i will not promote),"Hi everyone,  
I’m currently in a tricky situation at my startup job and would love your advice.

Two years ago, I joined a promising VC-backed startup after my plan to start at a large company with a salary of €60,000–€65,000 fell through due to a global hiring freeze. At the startup, I was offered a salary of €45,000 and shares worth €3,000, which were set to vest after two years.

After my first year, I received a raise of €7,500. However, this raise came from converting €5,000 worth of shares into salary—not by choice, but due to legal restrictions that prevented the shares from being assigned. Had I kept the shares, they’d be worth double that by now. To make matters worse, if this conversion hadn’t been done, my raise would have been just €2,500, which didn’t even keep up with inflation.

Now, I’m up for a promotion to Associate Product Manager, and I’ve learned that newly hired designers are being offered €75,000—much higher than my current salary. I have a background in both design and development and currently handle all design work, including migrating to a new component library and design system, while collaborating closely with the dev team.

The company has raised investments in the double-digit million range, so I know there’s funding available. I’m feeling frustrated and unsure how to approach my upcoming salary negotiation. Any advice on how to make a strong case?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d158,1ib58ly,Can I Get Into Startups Through Marketing? (I Will Not Promote),"Hi there,

I’ve been dreaming of getting into the startup world for years—it has always felt like the right fit for me. I’m ambitious, driven, strategic, a nonconformist, and someone who thinks outside the box, innovates, and challenges the status quo.



To give you some context, I’m from an island with a population of 100k. Opportunities here are scarce in nearly every field, and startups are virtually nonexistent. On top of that, not working in a field I feel passionate about has been draining me and making me feel less fulfilled with life every day.



I have no direct experience in startups; however, I’m naturally entrepreneurial. I’ve run businesses before and have been specializing in marketing. My focus has been on major topics like positioning, storytelling, funnels, strategy, and more. I’ve read many books on these subjects, including *Positioning*, *The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing*, *Lean Marketing*, the *Secrets Trilogy*, *Building a StoryBrand*, and others.



I don’t mind working for free for my first few clients, and I plan to find opportunities by posting on “\[Hiring/Seeking/Offering\] Jobs / Co-Founders Weekly Thread.”



I’ve also calculated the size of the market: approximately 50 million startups are created every year, with 99% being bootstrapped. This makes it an ideal entry point for me because the barrier to entry is low. If you’re wondering about my income expectations, $1,000 per month would be enough for me to live comfortably where I currently reside and where I plan to live in the future. I’m extremely frugal—my main concern is doing something I love.



My primary strategy for gaining recognition in this field is to create content daily on LinkedIn and X, as well as to network in communities on Reddit, Discord, and Slack.



So, my question is: Is it possible to break into startups this way? Or will I be excluded because I lack direct experience in the startup field?

But recently, life has been pulling me in another direction, and I’ve realized it’s time to step away. I don’t want to just let everything I’ve built go to waste, though. I’d love to find someone who’s passionate about this kind of work and can take it forward.

Has anyone here gone through something similar? How did you go about finding the right person to hand things over to? I want to make sure the transition is smooth for the clients and the brand itself.

If you’ve got any advice or ideas, I’d really appreciate it. And if anyone’s curious about eynix or wants to chat about it, feel free to DM me. Happy to share more details!

I am fortunate to be in a situation where I can freelance as a sales rep while trying to launch my own startup. I am also blessed with two kids ages 4 and 1. It is without a doubt, the hardest thing I've ever done. I would love to hear from other startup founders and early team members- HOW? 

I live in the NE region. We didn't have daycare during the holidays. No biggie, get to spend time with the kids and family. Then the day before they go back to school there's a snow storm whoch keeps the kids out of school for a week. After that it's two hour delays two days in a row. The next week is MLK, and then another set of snow which has school canceled the next day and ANOTHER two hour delay for two days. 

Both kids are picked up by 430 so 5pm they're here at home. There mother works also and we're obviously not in the situation for her to be a SAHM yet. I'm struggling to be able to get quality time to get things done. I haven't even gotten to cleaning the damn house 😒

In my last 2 years of uni, I consumed a lot of startup content, and had several ideas written down.

Graduating without a job made me want to join something, anything, and so I joined my current startup that had 2 founders. They had put in a lot of work which was clear, especially with how much outreach and the 20-30 waitilist signups they had. One did sales, the other desing. But they struggled with finding a good technical cofounder before me, and they themselves were almost a year out of school. They turned down job offers to pursue that startup together.

When I joined as the technical cofounder, they were already demotivated from working so hard, because the previous technical cofounder made basically no progress. So they started looking for jobs when I joined, and 3 months into it, they got good jobs at startups. They had to leave. It has been me leading the ship solo since.

It's been a rollercoaster, and things are looking up, especially after I launched the beta in early nov. I am hopeful and we are making progress.

I'm wondering if anyone else entered the startup world with a similar story?",startups,1737938016.0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1iav5qq/anyone_else_got_forced_into_doing_a_startup_i/

Have equity discussion asap esp regarding vesting and cliff

6799340e3474f2d0be95d163,1iasse2,FAANG vs Startups - I will not promote,"tldr: do it, start that company.

(I originally posted this in the ycombinator forum, but thought some of you might like to read it as well)

The other day, I read a comment on Reddit’s YC forum that deeply bothered me. It’s a common sentiment that I’ve heard before. My issue doesn’t even lie in its accuracy, as I agree that it’s probably true. But I believe strongly that in optimizing results based on one metric, a great deal of other possible motivations are swept to the wayside without a thought.

&gt; “Most founders and startup employees should just go work in FAANG instead. The monetary gains from working a stable high paying job for 7-10 years outweighs the potential reward from your startup succeeding, since most don’t. On top of that, your income will pale in comparison to what could have been were you to instead just go work for Google”.

Here is my response to that form of thinking. To all founders, creatives, tinkerers, and dreamers:

# 1. Agree: FAANG will pay better

First, I do agree with the claims of that comment, at least on a purely monetary level. When reduced to simple probability, a stable career in FAANG will almost assuredly result in more money for the person involved. That’s true. I don’t have much else to say on that matter, except that this is where my agreement starts and ends.

---

With that out of the way, let me list my grievances:

# 1. FAANG Time ≠ Startup Time

Sure, you will probably make more money going the FAANG route. Especially as a founder who is pre-revenue, pre-PMF. But those 7-10 years spent in FAANG are in no ways equal to what your journey will be if you instead choose to go the startup route. By going the stable route, you will deal with red tape. You will be blocked by pointless bureaucracy. You will often have to ask for permission. Your instinct and intuition will be curbed by those who are risk averse. You’ll have to do the political dance, often times dimming your own light in order to appease those who would rather just coast along, whether that be managers, peers, or your entire team. The chances of you spending a large portion of your time on things you care little-to-nothing about are quite high, even though you’ll often be expected to feign excitement.

Founders have little tolerance for doing any of those things, especially for a period of time as long as 7-10 years. To someone like me, working this way is pretty akin to death. There is no question about it. I will happily work twice as hard for 25% as much, as long as I can be captain of my own ship. When I have ultimate authority and responsibility, when “The buck stops here”, I operate differently. That leads me to my next point.

# 2. How do you want to live?

For many, being a founder means being able to live more authentically. This argument may be more on the philosophical side, but it’s still one that is important to consider. By choosing to start a company instead of going the more guaranteed and stable route, a person is declaring something about who they are and what their values are. For example, I highly value autonomy, creativity, speed, and hard work done at a high level. While many large companies and most teams would probably say the same, it’s usually only in word. In my experience, very few actually put these ideas into practice. The smaller the company, the closer I’ve seen genuine adherence to those ideals.

I like waking up to chaos and opportunity each day, like a ship out on the open sea. Knowing that it is truly sink or swim enables me to more easily cut out the cruft, focusing on what truly matters. It makes me feel more alive, more engaged with my work, more inspired, and more challenged. Spot an incredible challenge, and you’ll soon see a great opportunity for growth following quickly behind; not only from a professional standpoint but from a personal one as well.

# 3. What of a dream?

This is for my dreamers. Those who aren’t primarily motivated about the potential status or fame that can arise from creating a highly successful startup. Those who, above all, see a problem and have a dream, and will stop at nothing to see it through. There is a special kind of satisfaction that comes from pouring everything you have into pursuing a dream, even if you know the chances are slim. For someone like this, there is no amount of FAANG money that can replace this.

If you ask me to trade my dreams for money, and for time that I’ll never get back, I’ll have made up my mind before you even finish your proposal. I know what it means to be financially limited while pursuing my dreams, and I know what it means to sacrifice them to instead be highly compensated. The latter made me feel dead inside. The former has completely altered my entire outlook on life, transforming what I think of myself, what I’m capable of, the world around me, and even my own place within it.

So I say, without hesitation, unequivocally and with deep conviction, do it. Start that company, pursue that dream. Better to have tried and failed than to look back and always wonder “what if”?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d168,1iaoejd,Seeking Advice: Should I pivot my startup? | I will not promote,"Hi everyone,

I’m the founder of a platform \[starteraid\] that was originally designed to help entrepreneurs bring their business ideas to life. Our initial concept focused on guiding users through the early stages of starting a business by connecting them with essential resources. While we’ve seen strong interest in terms of clicks, our conversion rates have been low—which got me thinking about whether the concept resonates enough with our audience.

Lately, I’ve been exploring the idea of pivoting it into a vendor-matching platform. The new focus would help startups and small businesses find and connect with curated vendor recommendations tailored to their business type. Instead of being a general startup resource hub, it would be more about matching businesses with the right suppliers or service providers based on their needs (e.g., marketing, accounting, raw materials).

This pivot is inspired by feedback and the pain points I’ve observed—specifically how challenging it is for small businesses to find trustworthy, relevant vendors. I’d still aim to keep the process simple and user-friendly, leveraging the same core features from the original concept.

My questions to you are:

   1. Does this pivot make sense, based on the problem it aims to solve?

   2. Have you faced challenges as a startup or small business owner finding vendors or service providers?

   3. Would this kind of platform provide value to you or businesses you know?

   4. Do you have any suggestions for validating this pivot further or improving the concept?

I really appreciate any advice or feedback from this community! This is still in the early phase, and I want to make sure I’m heading in the right direction before making big changes.

This is supposed to be a forum of creative and empathetic people. I’m disappointed that people are so damned focused on the implementation of a solution instead of focusing on the problem. Isn’t that what a startup is all about and why you’re here?

For me, I understand the primary pain to be the potential of having to sift through a ton of either blatant, or thinly veiled, advertisements to get any tiny nuggets that can be helpful in my startup journey - ESPECIALLY when those promotional posts come from new / bot accounts that haven’t contributed meaningfully towards the community.  

Does anyone disagree that this is the primary pain?Startup mantra #1 focus on the pain! 

I think we can also agree that, as a startup, promotion can be difficult and that there are a lot of people here with good ideas and viewpoints who could help and or be potential customers. (Secondary pain). 

If only there was a system that could measure POSITIVE contribution to this sub… oh wait, there is a way for the community to decide what is valuable and give that person magical internet points. Instead of just complaining and arguing and threatening to unsubscribe, why has no one thought of a “new business model”where you could actually EARN the ability to occasionally promote by contributing to the community? For every X karma earn 1 promotional post. 

I’m not here to promote a specific solution. I am here to say I’m disappointed to see nearly everyone completely forgetting the key underlying rule of startups - focus on a problem instead of falling in love with (or bitching about) the solution.

What I've found is that the mental block is often the first thing holding people back from success—even when they have the skills. It’s the fear of rejection, the doubts about pricing, or even just the challenge of creating a consistent process for qualifying leads.

If any of these sound like challenges you're facing, or if you're looking to level up in any of these areas, feel free to drop me a message! I’d love to chat about how small shifts in your approach can make a big difference. No pitch, just a genuine conversation. I'm trying to network on this subreddit, not gonna sell you anything. 

Curious to hear how others are handling these challenges too—so feel free to share any thoughts or questions!",startups,1737885581.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1iaaouq/mastering_the_mental_side_of_business_i_will_not/

But here's the thing: the culture is in shambles. 

1. People dissing each other behind the back (even dissing the founders) 
2. Culture of fear: people afraid of suggesting improvements, correcting stuff that's horribly wrong, in fear of push backs and arguments (I'm talking arguments among employees, etc.). 
3. No process or accountability. People entering or leaving the office whenever they feel like it. 
4. Generally submitting shitty work. 

Now, I know it's not my place to go out and try to change all this as an employee. It's the role of the founder.

I am thinking about some new ideas while figuring out what to do with my platform project (my co founder disappeared, because of his private life) and I am asking how you guys are tackling the topic of product validation.

For the old product I checked the market and saw that there is competition, but they had no digital version which people were asking for (there are surveys for it). So I took that as a part of the validation. But how are you doing it in general?

I have issues with that waiting list approach: Giving an email address out is pretty easy and does not mean a lot in my opinion. Also even if I am interested in something I would not sign up for a newsletter, but I would be happy to tell the founder if he would ask me.

I really like the approach of a MVP like AirBnB did renting their own room or some delivery services just delivering it by themselves. But I think that is not possible in every case.

So how are you doing it? Are you trying to talk to people? But how are you filtering it the case out that sometimes a product is too new for some users? Like if you would have asked anyone in 2005 there is a high chance that they would not say that they need an iPhone. Also Harry Potter was rejected a lot of times.

Thanks and have a great weekend!

6799340e3474f2d0be95d17f,1i9xx7f,[i will not promote]Would you be interested in cutting recruitment costs by up to 90% while getting the same output?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been exploring the idea of building a recruitment model that focuses on hiring skilled Indian talent to help businesses significantly cut costs—by up to 90%—while maintaining or even improving the quality of work. I wanted to get your feedback on this concept before I move forward with it.

Here are a few examples of how this could work:

Tech roles: Hiring a software developer in the US can cost upwards of $100k annually, while a highly-skilled developer from India with the same expertise can deliver the same output for $15-25k.

Marketing or back-office support: Remote marketing assistants, content creators, or customer support agents can cost businesses a fraction of what they’d pay locally while being just as effective.

Niche expertise: India has a large pool of professionals experienced in fields like finance, engineering, design, and more, available at globally competitive rates.


Why this makes sense:

1. Cost-effectiveness: You’re not compromising on skills, just benefiting from lower living costs in India.


2. Skilled workforce: India has a large pool of well-educated professionals across industries who are comfortable working with international clients.


3. Proven success: Many global companies (big and small) already work with Indian talent for everything from IT services to creative work.



If you’re a business owner or involved in recruitment, would you consider adopting this model? What concerns or challenges would you have about working with remote Indian talent?

I’m in the process of refining this idea and would love to hear your thoughts or feedback. Your insights would be incredibly valuable in shaping this initiative.

Thanks in advance for sharing your perspective!

I have a stable software engineering job at a  big financial institution in a LCOL city. I do somewhat enjoy the work that I do but it is slow, and I yearn for a more dynamic and entrepreneurial environment so I spend most of my time out of work trying to work on little side projects and learning. I also do not enjoy living in the city I am in.

A friend of mine founded a startup and raised a small round from a reputable VC, he wants me to join as a founding engineer. He’s been in the VC realm for a while and I believe in him as a founder. If we find a fit, he would be offering me a matched salary (after adjusted for COL) as well as equity (not sure how much). It is an interesting / promising product and the idea of building something from the early stages in a startup environment excites me. 

I have laid out the pros and cons:

Pros:
- Finally get to experience the startup environment I have dreamed of (networking, strategy, etc)
- Opportunity to grow out of strictly technical role (I want this)
- Little to no financial hit in terms of income (except if / until the startup fails)
- Get to move to a city closer to family and friends (I hate where I live)
- LEARN faster with less red tape and build more. 
- Am young (early 20s) with no debt, responsibilities and decent savings

Cons:

- leave very stable job for extremely risky one
- Job market could not be worse
- less/no work life balance
- Loss of benefits 
- Removing solid brand name from resume 

I’ve been passionate about startups for a long time and fear if I don’t take this I’ll regret it later. Even in the worst case scenario where the startup fails after a year I don’t see myself regretting it because I am confident there will be invaluable learning / growth during that year.

Two packaging options that are popular to our clients are box sleeves and custom-printed boxes. So if maybe you’re considering either of them, here’s a quick rundown of the two:

**Box sleeves** work for smaller orders because they’re more budget-friendly, costing less than fully printed boxes. These are mostly used for seasonal promotions or product variations. You can use plain boxes and swap out the sleeves for different designs. They’re customizable in terms of size (2"" to 12"" in length, 0.5"" to 6"" in width, and 2"" to 18"" in height) and material (18 pt. or 24 pt. cardstock). Then you can choose coatings like glossy UV, matte UV, or soft touch lamination (which may be done with custom prints as well). They’re commonly used for apparel, soaps, food packaging, and cosmetics. You can have them coated with aqueous coating, glossy UV, matte UV, glossy + matte UV, or soft touch lamination.  

Now **custom printed boxes** offer a more polished, premium look because you can tailor the dimensions exactly to your product. They’re actually cost-effective in bulk so it’s recommended for stable product lines or for long-term branding. They also create a high-end unboxing experience that go well for e-commerce business (subscription boxes or promotional kits). There are also other premium features that you can add like foil stamping, add window cut-outs for a sneak peek at the packed item, or use spot UV to add depth and contrast to your designs, and more.

When you start a business you actually have an uphill battle were you are fighting alone in the start. You need to focus on the key elements on those initial days.

* First few hires - See you can't fight a battle alone you need to hire people whose vision align with yours and they can handle the chaos of the startup environment. Always keep in mind first few hires are crucial to the growth of the organization.
* First customers - Getting your first customers is never easy, but it’s the proof of concept. I remember hustling to get early customers through direct outreach, cold emails, calls, networking events, etc. it perfectly worked in my case, you just need to get creative. You won’t have a sales team or a brand to rely on, so it’s on you to close the first few deals and learn from their feedback. 
* First Revenue - See It’s not just about survival; it’s about proving that your ideation works. In the first few months, every dollar will count, and its important to prioritize cash flow over everything else (exceptions are everywhere). So this is where you start making strategic move.
* Profits - Many founders scale too quickly, thinking they need to raise more money and grow their team before they hit profitability. Don’t make this mistake (Note - Startups and hypergrowth are not included in this case). It gives you control over your business and ensures you can continue scaling without depending on outside funding. My advice is to focus on building a sustainable model early on.

Then Scaling a mid-sized Biz

Once you know your weapon, its time to be in the real game. Growth requires resources both human and financial. You need to balance scaling efficiently cz here efficiency is the key.

* Hiring for growth - Now, you need to hire specialists. You’ve already built a foundation with a solid team, but as you scale, you need to bring in people with specific expertise. Marketing, sales, finance, and customer support cz these are people you can’t afford to ignore if you want to scale effectively.
* Systems &amp; Processes - In the early days, you may get away with improvising. But once you hit a certain size, systems and processes become essential. You need to some kind of automatic process to be there to repeat certain tasks, streamline workflows, and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Here you will also need to invest in a few solid tools for CRM, project management, and accounting will set you up for smoother scaling.
* Customer Retention &amp; Scaling Revenue - Now, the focus should shift from *acquiring* customers to *retaining* them. Retention is far more profitable than acquisition. You customers must become the part of your product. Offer great customer service, build loyalty, and listen to their feedback.
* Turn your profits to your growth - Reinvesting is a the best decision at this stage. Now that your company is generating a steady income, you’ve got more flexibility to make bold moves. Also, it’s important not to burn through your cash quickly. Make sure each decision you make is backed by data and is aligned with your long-term goals.

So this was my experience till now. If I had to sum it up in a few words: Focus on the fundamentals early—customers, cash flow, and a solid team—and then scale intelligently. Once you’ve built a profitable business, look for ways to turn that into a long-term growth model.

Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. So stay focused, stay lean, and most importantly, keep learning and evolving as you go.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d190,1i917sp,Deciding Cap Table for University Spinout [I will not promote],"I'm currently planning to spin out a ""deep tech"" startup from a university, and our founding team is working out how to divide up our initial capitalization table. 

Without going into too many specifics, our team consists primarily of two PhD students (A and B) and a faculty advisor (C) , as well as a masters student (D) who isn't looking to be a co-founder but would come on as an early employee. 

The focus of this post is about the equity split between A and B. All things being equal, it would be a largely 50/50 split between A and B. However, A is preparing to graduate by May/June, meanwhile B is still a ways away from graduating. It is customary in this field for PhDs to publish 3 peer-reviewed articles in order to be cleared to graduate by their committee; A has published 2 and is preparing their 3rd, meanwhile B is still trying to publish their first paper. As optimistic as they would like to be, the practical reality is that there is probably at least another year before B can graduate, perhaps longer depending on how peer review goes.

There is overlap between tech development through research and the tech development needs of the startup (it is a university project spinout, after all), but realistically B can't get closer to graduating when working on tasks that solely serve the venture. It's estimated B could devote maybe \~10 hr/week to value-adding activities for the venture without compromising progress on their academic responsibilities in order to publish and graduate. Alternatively, B could devote more time to the fledgling venture, but that might push graduation date back from 12 months to 16 or 18 months (or more). 

For those that have been in/seen a similar situation before, what have you seen/what would you recommend? Looking at it purely from a lifetime venture hours-worked perspective, over 10 years this discrepancy in the first year doesn't make a huge difference (esp. if B makes up for it in years 2-4) and a 51/49 split between A and B is how the estimated contribution hours math works out. For a 4 year vesting horizon, the difference in contributions over those 4 years is closer to a 55-45 split, and could be closer to 60-40 if B is not able to become full time in 12 months or less. 

Aside from the equity split, would the typical 4 year vesting / 1 year cliff configuration make sense in this situation? The cliff is the safety valve if something is not working out in the first year, but B might be earning an undue amount of grace for ""not contributing much"" because they're trying to graduate ASAP, and so in a sense that safety valve might get partially wasted only being 1 year long while B is quarter-time. Is there precedent for unequal cliff periods for founders if one is full time and the other is part time?

Advice on how to look at this? I understand the equity is largely an incentive for future work that doesn't start until Day 1 of the formed venture, so historical time spent on the project isn't being factored into this split (else A would be getting more than 50% if the view was both past and future looking). If B is busting their ass to finish a PhD and work on a venture, only to be getting 30% (before dilution) when all is said and done, that's objectively demotivating when their 50/50 partner is getting double the equity mainly by virtue of being a year ahead. Still, the unequal contributions in the first year aren't nothing, and need to be accounted for in some way, right?

  
Additional (optional) context for those who would have questions, commentary about the other characters:

Due to their financial situation (has a kid), D is advocating for being paid a modest salary when they start instead of receiving a considerable (10%+) equity position. We're already planning for unallocated shares in an ESOP for an employee option pool, which they would be eligible for in a comp package down the line depending on how things go/if they stick with the company, etc. They came on after the invention process, were the one to pitch this proposition, and are whip-smart with industry experience so they understand what they're signing up for with this arrangement (10% of 0 is still 0, and the family would much rather have cash than a percentage of 0). We have grant funding secured for the first phase of commercialization, which we sought in large part to cover early employee salary. 

C (faculty advisor) has no plans of leaving their tenured academic career, but is looking to serve in an advisory role and help with networking and grant fundraising, and is expected to take a 0.5 - 1.0% stake as is typical of this kind of arrangement.",startups,1737740658.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i917sp/deciding_cap_table_for_university_spinout_i_will/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d191,1i8z07w,Looking for investors (i will not promote),"Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out to seek your support for an idea that could revolutionize the field of smart home technology.

Today, most smart home devices rely on constant internet access, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, the real issue lies in the dependency on cloud services for many of these devices. This reliance often raises privacy concerns for users who value their personal data.

My solution is to create a fully autonomous system that operates independently of the cloud.

This system would act as the central brain of the home, making it feel almost alive. It would enable automated management of doors, motion sensors, light sensors, ambient temperature sensors, and even infrared vision.

Imagine walking into a room, and the temperature is automatically adjusted based on your body heat. Or while you sleep, the system detects and disables devices deemed unnecessary, significantly reducing your electricity bill—all without relying on the cloud.

Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, our system would adapt to your lifestyle seamlessly. As a bonus, each night before bed and every morning, you’d receive a detailed report summarizing all activities and observations made throughout the day and night—all accessible from your smartphone. You could also customize the system to suit your preferences directly through your phone, ensuring it integrates perfectly with your way of life.

I’m reaching out to investors and anyone interested in supporting this project. Our immediate goal is to develop an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to bring this concept to life. After that, we aim to raise further funding to scale and fully develop the solution.

We estimate that $15,000 to $20,000 would be sufficient to cover the complete development of the MVP.

For those interested in learning more about the project, I’m open to discussions and happy to share further details.

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read this and consider supporting or discussing this vision with us.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d193,1i8wx5c,Stop trying to find a tech cofounder by pitching your idea alone (let’s help new founders) I will not promote,"Hey you, non technical founder about to post your idea and ask for someone who can develop to join you. 

Stop for a moment and think about what they deal with on a regular basis from dozens of others like you. 

We’ve seen hundreds of founders try it and get frustrated because nobody responds. 

There is a better way, and that is to prove to that tech founders you can SELL and not just have an idea. 

Think about how to stand out to that potential tech cofounder. What do you bring to the table the others can’t? What does a startup need to make it worth their time, risk, and cost of opportunity. 

Especially if you can’t pay them. 

The best tech cofounder I ever had came on because I was already selling and masking revenue with an MVP as a consultant. Not only did I share my idea and vision, I shared my ability to execute and sell. We started off with one project and built chemistry from there. Eventually we interviewed at YC. Every milestone built more trust and commitment. 

This is if you have the idea first. An even better way is to find a problem they want to work on and show that you have founder-market fit. Show them your potential to get initial traction and let them focus on what they want to do. 

Dreams and promises mean nothing to a competent programmer that could easily stay at their cushy job or have multiple opportunities. 

Another founder I know was a car salesman. He went out and founded a solo founder that made a similar product to his idea in product hunt and said he would prove his passion for the problem by selling. They’re now 50/50 and crushing it (didn’t need investors because of revenue). 

It takes time, too. 

A founder once told me after being terribly frustrated with trying to find a tech cofounder. They said, “Ed, it’s like dating to get married but I’m bringing my kids.” I’d never made that connection but so true. 

Alright, for the rest of you that have great cofounders, how did you find them? And for you tech cofounders, what do you need to see?

Website design and flow – Maybe it’s not user-friendly or engaging enough?

Call-to-Action (CTA) – Are the CTAs weak, or am I not guiding visitors effectively?

Pricing or trust issues – Could the pricing or lack of testimonials/credibility be scaring people off?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d1a0,1i8dgxd,Co-Founder Deception: Need Advice After Realizing a Friend is Manipulating the Business. (i will not promote),"Hi Reddit,

I’m a developer and technical founder of several projects, including:

1. **A travel company**
2. **A photography company**
3. **A wooden frames business** (selling photos in custom wooden frames)
4. **A clothing brand** (with other co-founders)

I’m now facing a dilemma with one of my co-founders—who is also a close friend.

Here’s the situation:  
This friend is a talented photographer with all the necessary equipment for photography, cinematography, and drones. I pitched the idea of starting a photography business together, explaining the business model, percentages, and margins. He seemed excited, committed, and gave me confidence that we’d make a great team.

Originally, I was focused on the **travel** and **clothing** projects, and the photography business was secondary. Due to a mutual agreement, I didn’t hire any other photographer but him, believing we would work together. We also agreed that I would handle the technical side, while he would handle the media.

However, things have taken a pretty ugly turn. I recently found out that he’s been acting manipulative. It turns out, he never really had any intention of working as a co-founder with us, despite what he said. He’s been deliberately holding us back, possibly because he wants to run the business alone, with his own people, and has even gone as far as trying to copy our business model.

I trusted him to handle the photography for our **clothing** and **travel** brands (model shoots, product photos, photos of properties, etc.). As we all know, without the photography, video, and aerial content, we can’t advertise anything properly. This is crucial to our marketing and visibility. But now, I’m left with no choice but to hire freelancers to cover those roles.

In the **wooden frame business**, he holds the right to source the wooden frames from the manufacturer's workshop and deliver them on time. But now, he wants to split this responsibility and get his own team involved. It’s frustrating because he seems more interested in taking control of everything for himself.

As for the **clothing business**, he is responsible for handling the manufacturing part. My other team handles the design, quality, and shipping. However, he has messed up with the manufacturing side of things, which is causing additional delays and problems.

To make things more complicated, I’m a **techie** and really struggle with hiring and managing freelancers. Some of the ones I’ve worked with have not met the high standards required for our professional client work. It’s been challenging because I expect top-notch quality, and managing freelancers who don’t meet those expectations has been a roadblock.

The worst part is that **we, the other team members, are earning nothing** because of his mistakes and greed. He’s putting the success of the business at risk, and we are stuck with no revenue coming in, despite putting in a lot of hard work.

The real kicker is that **he was initially very excited** to work with us, but once he saw how much profit could be made, and that it would need to be distributed equally, he backstabbed us. He didn’t want to share the success and now seems to be plotting against us.

To give some context, I have my own **design &amp; technical team**, while he works with the **media &amp; marketing team**. But he’s completely fallen short in fulfilling his responsibilities in that area.

It’s painful because I really respected him and his work, but his actions have shattered that trust. He doesn’t seem interested in the success of the other co-founders and seems to want to take everything for himself.

I’ve taken him on as a *media partner* instead of a co-founder for now, but I’m seriously reconsidering what to do next.

Has anyone here gone through something similar? How did you handle discovering betrayal or manipulation in a co-founder relationship? How do you move on from this kind of situation without letting it destroy your business or your friendships?

Would love to hear your advice and experiences.

1. I got some revenue from Screen Studio affiliate program (yay!). It is a screen &amp; camera recorder with super-easy intuitive UI for making product demos. No referral link; the domain name matches the software name - Google it. ;)
2. Now, my videos have a nice thumbnail (as opposed to a single frame I had before). I believe this one rocketed my CTR from \~1.5-3% to an astonishing 10-15%. The average now is 4.5%. The thumbnail (+ logo and OG image template) was made by a guy from Twitter for a super-affordable price.
3. Everyone talks about SEO or ASEO (App-Store SEO). Why did no one mention YSEO (YouTube SEO?). I decided to give it a try and added some competitor names to the descriptions of my videos. No results yet, but let's see.
4. Since my first contact with the public, I got 92 signups (in a \~month).
5. I have got multiple ""you have a good (great) service, but I lack X, Y, and Z"". Building in Public taught me to be not afraid to ask potential users why they are here (especially if you have a nice signup rate).
6. I sent almost 90 E-Mails to the users who signed up and got around 6-7 responses. The response rate went up once I changed the subject to ""Quick question (Bohdan from &lt;mystartup&gt;)"". Thanks to a guy from Twitter who recommended me to do this.
7. As opposed to my previous startup, this one, being not developer-focused, allowed me to cut so many corners I never cut in my life developing the software. Some of my pages still lack pagination. Where the SaaS shine - SEO. I strive to add as many details as I can to the entities users post on the service (LD-JSON schemas, IndexNow, page structure, etc).
8. Most interesting part: my MRR now is ~~$122123~~ zero (like, the real $0). Most probably, some clients will arrive once I complete a few core features they were asking for, but who knows?
9. Previous (failed) startup gave me excellent contact with AppSumo. We've already had a call on potential cooperation as a Select product and agreed to meet again in early Spring if I meet the basic goals they set for me (certain customer number, some steady growing MRR, etc).
10. Ah, right... I am eating my dog food and I created a tiny directory for the local market - indoor playgrounds/playrooms. I don't know if the idea is going to work out - the search results are bloated with SERP features and it is hard for a user to navigate. Despite all of that, there are some impressions already, but not too much of clicks. I hope the situation will be improved with the better page titles/descriptions, but the experiment has just started.

I’m building a platform that brings **TV-style advertising** to original social media content. The goal is to let content creators monetize their work through **non-intrusive ad formats**, so viewers can enjoy original content without sitting through long sponsored videos.

Here’s how it works:

* **Screenbugs**: Small logos or product images in the corner of a video.
* **Banners**: Horizontal ads displayed at the bottom of a video.
* **L-Wraps**: Ads with an L-shape overlay running alongside the content.
* **Affiliate Links**: Brands can add affiliate links that will end in video descriptions.
* **Brand Mentions**: Content creators can mention brands in their videos.

Unlike other UGC platforms where creators rely on creating full-blown sponsored content, Parvakit focuses on **non-intrusive, TV-style ads** that integrate seamlessly into videos. This allows creators to monetize effectively without altering their original content, while brands still gain visibility and engagement.

1. Do you think brands would find these ad formats compelling?
2. Would creators prefer this over traditional sponsorships?
3. How could I improve this platform to make it more appealing to both sides?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d1b3,1i83bc6,SaaS Branding mistakes: That Makes Your SaaS Company Look like a DIY Project Gone Wrong (I Will Not Promote),"Remember when you tried to assemble IKEA furniture without the instructions? Yeah, that Sunday afternoon that turned into a frustrating mess. Similarly, whenever a SaaS company tries to create its brand identity without a proper plan, it ends up looking like Frankenstein's monster. So imma break down some of the most common branding mistakes that can make your SaaS company stand out for all the wrong reasons.



1. Overuse of Blue

Blue is usually associated with trust and tech, but the overuse of this color in SaaS brands has made it much harder for new SaaS brands to stand out in this crowded industry. Try to go in the opposite direction and use something that conveys warmth and energy, like orange, or something that indicates innovation, like purple.



2. Relying on generic stock images

Customers want to connect with an authentic brand, but the use of stock images or icons will make your brand look unoriginal, and they might feel disconnected. Invest in good photos and illustrations to add to your brand's visual identity that speaks about your products to your audience.



3. Overloading design element

Focus on a clean and purposeful design that communicates about your brand quickly. Avoid excessive colors, multiple fonts, complex layouts, or busy elements. Keep in mind that you have to communicate about your product in a few seconds and also have to tell a complex message at the same time.



4. Unoriginal Brand Marks

Logos and brand marks are direct representations of your brand, so avoid the usage of generic tech symbols like clouds or gears on your logo or as brand patterns, like a cloud for cloud-based storage. Develop your own unique symbols that communicate your mission and align with your brand's visual aesthetics.



5. Underestimating Typeface Impact

Don't stick to generic fonts that erode your brand's personality. Look for typefaces that align with your brand's personality, or just invest in custom typefaces. They are not only there to display text, but they also convey emotions. A modern sans serif with round edges can feel more approachable, while a serif typeface can feel more premium.



6. Inconsistent Collateral

Align all your branding elements across platforms, that way people see your brand as trustworthy. If you're using a bold and bright color on your website but your social media or email campaigns are dull and muted, it creates a disbalance and might feel disconnected from your brand. Use a brand guide to ensure all the elements are consistent across all platforms.



7. Overlooking Favicon Design

Don't forget to add a favicon. They are often overlooked but are crucial in terms of branding. Create a simplified version of your logo to maintain clarity instead of shrinking your original logo.



8. Poor Adaptability

Make sure to check if all the necessary elements, like logos, buttons, and headings, are adaptable to different backgrounds and platforms. Many brands found out later that their elements disappeared in different backgrounds or just didn't look good on specific platforms. Develop multiple variations of all the elements, like a light and dark variation, to ensure consistency across every platform.



9. Complicating Rebranding

Avoid rebranding and changes in your brand's design elements frequently. Try subtle changes to your brand visuals and build up from there gradually. Just like Google, they keep changing their visuals now and then, and they do it quite subtly over the years to maintain familiarity and make the logo look polished and modern at the same time.



10. Color Psychology

Colors are pretty essential when it comes to branding and connecting with your audience. For example, if you see a security company using a bright red color as their website's primary color, then your brain might feel panic rather than put trust in their product. Look up the term 'color psychology' and choose colors and hues that complement your products and services. Make sure that your colors are aligned with customer expectations and your core offering.



11. Neglected Secondary Colors

Relying solely on primary brand colors is restrictive. Develop a strong secondary palette for illustrations, charts, and accents. For example, a purple primary SaaS could add complementary shades of coral and mint for visual balance.



12. Skipping Packaging and other print Collaterals

Many SaaS brands tend to overlook their print collaterals and packaging designs. Bad packaging of SaaS products can degrade the product's unboxing experience and first impression, and badly designed print assets like business cards or brochures can hugely impact your brand's image in a bad way at in-person pitches or conferences. Design high-quality print materials that represent your digital identity in the physical world properly.",startups,1737638837.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i83bc6/saas_branding_mistakes_that_makes_your_saas/

I've been trying to build micro SaaS/startups over the last 4 years.

**✅ Good Hero Sections Examples**

**1. Stripe**

* **Headline:** ""Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue.”
* **Subheading:** ""Join the millions of companies of all sizes that use Stripe to accept payments online and in person, embed financial services, power custom revenue models, and build a more profitable business.""
* **CTA:** ""Start now"" (simple, clear, not playing games).
* **Visual:** Gorgeous UI screenshots of the product working in real life.
* *Why it works:* Stripe tells you exactly what they do, and the CTA doesn't beg for attention, it demands action. Plus, no stock photos - just real stuff you can understand.

**2. Calendly**

* **Headline:** ""Easy scheduling ahead.""
* **Subheading:** ""Join 20 million professionals who easily book meetings with the #1 scheduling tool.""
* **CTA:** “Sign up” (because it knows you might actually need it).
* **Visual:** A clean, minimal illustration showing a simple calendar interface with easy-to-book slots.
* *Why it works:* Clear and straightforward. The headline explains the core value, while the subheading elaborates on the pain point it solves. Easily. Book. Meetings.

**❌ Bad Hero Sections Examples**

**1. Another GPT Wrapper**

* **Headline:** “Innovating the Future of Synergy.”
* **Subheading:** “Our AI-powered solutions will revolutionize your business and probably your life too.”
* **CTA:** ""Learn more"" (because you’re clearly dying to).
* **Visual:** Stock photo of a person in a suit shaking hands with a smiling robot.
* *Why it’s bad:* The ultimate “I have no idea what you do” section. Buzzwords? Check. Vague nonsense? Check. CTA that makes you want to hit the back button? Double check.

**2. Startup Without a Clue**

* **Headline:** “Disrupting the Status Quo.”
* **Subheading:** “Join us in revolutionizing how people experience \[insert vague thing here\].”
* **CTA:** “Join us” (or keep wondering what the hell this even means)
* **Visual:** A confused mess of icons or abstract shapes that look like they were randomly thrown together by an intern.
* *Why it’s bad:* An example of a hero section that prioritizes marketing jargon over meaningful communication about the product's actual purpose.",startups,1737637038.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i82qun/hero_sections_the_good_the_bad_and_the_cringe_i/

However, my wedding is coming up in about a month and so I've had to spend a lot of my non-work hours on wedding prep as well and I've been sleeping an average of 4h a day for a month now, trying to juggle everything. 

Our app is live right now, though pretty preliminary (we just wanted to launch quickly) but seeing people log in and just do stuff on the app always pumps me up. My co-founder has also been conducting user interviews regularly and we have a whole backlog of features that we want to build.

My original plan was that after the wedding I'll definitely have more bandwidth, and once our app reaches a certain revenue or we get some funding, I'll quit my full time job. But I definitely have ""founder's guilt"" where whenever I do something that isn't related to our app (like life stuff, or other work), I feel like I'm ""not doing enough"". 

I see a lot of stories of founders who ""took the plunge"" and quit first because they wanted to give 100%. I'm always so impressed and I want to be as brave, but I'm scared because I don't have a large sum of savings to fall back on. And honestly, I also don't want to add an additional burden to my partner whom I'm going to have a shared life with soon.

Managed to get 500 users in just 15 days using these methods—thought they might help you, too! Let me know what you think.

1.  **Be active on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Reddit** Share your journey and tool. Don’t just post—engage, comment, and genuinely connect with people in your niche.
2. **Reach out directly to your target audience** Ask them to try your tool and share honest feedback. This can help refine your product and build early trust.
3. **Launch on Product Hunt (and similar platforms)** Product Hunt can give great traction. Look for alternatives, too, so you’re not putting all your eggs in one basket.
4. **Leverage your personal network** Friends, colleagues, ex-bosses—anyone who can offer feedback or introduce you to potential users. Early validation is gold.
5. **List your product on directories** There are tons of directories for AI tools and SaaS platforms. Being everywhere increases your chances of getting discovered.
6. **Collaborate with a budget-friendly influencer** Find someone who resonates with your niche. Even a smaller influencer can bring in a dedicated audience.
7. **Create value-driven content and share it for free** Think blog posts, short guides, or checklists related to AI marketing. It positions you as an authority and attracts potential users.
8. **Record walkthroughs of your tool** A quick screen-recorded demo can highlight your features in action. People love a clear, visual explanation.
9. **Build or optimize your website** Keep it simple and conversion-focused.
10. **Repurpose your content** Write blog posts on your own site, then publish them on Medium, LinkedIn, and other platforms to reach a bigger audience.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d1bb,1i7yu24,Cofounder CTO doesn't want to go fulltime  - I will not promote,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently building a travel marketplace. Initially, I created a template-based platform, complemented with custom code via freelancers, to validate the idea. This helped me acquire some initial users, especially on the supply side (the demand side is already validated in the market).

Later, I met an IT professional with a similar idea, and we decided to join forces using his custom-built website. As a result, I paused my platform (which, although more feature-rich than his site, was less scalable and robust in terms of usability, scalability, and SEO) and stopped acquiring users to avoid double registrations. He adapted his website to align with my vision, brand, and functionalities (though it still lacks some features my previous platform had).

We signed a 50/50 founders' agreement, committing to work on this full-time. Now, as we approach the stage of seeking seed funding, he has informed me that he cannot leave his job until 2027 due to his commitment to purchasing a property, as the bank requires him to maintain his current job stability.

This poses significant challenges—not only for the upcoming seed round, which might be manageable with the right explanation, but especially for future rounds. I find it hard to imagine raising a Series A with a part-time co-founder.

I’ve tried discussing alternatives with him, such as compensating him for his work so far (offering €3-5k), milestone-based payments, and stock options. However, he insists on retaining 20% equity and working part-time.

I’m struggling with how to proceed. Raising funds with a part-time co-founder until 2027 seems very difficult. On the other hand, if we part ways, he owns the website along with the user database, which is a major concern.

What would you do in this situation? How would you approach it?

Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

My questions for the community:

* If you’ve found a co-founder outside your personal network, how did you go about it?
* What qualities or skills do you think are most important in a non-technical co-founder?
* How do you approach equity discussions for someone joining after the tech/product is already built?

I'm deciding between a Free Trial and a Freemium model for my SaaS product and could really use your advice on which tends to be better for driving revenue?

Here are my questions with both-

**Free Trial** gives full access but just for a short period. I wonder if the pressure of a deadline really gets people to subscribe, or if they just bounce when the trial’s up.

**Freemium** lets users access basic features for free forever, hoping they'll want more and pay for upgrades. Does this actually happen, or do users stick with the freebies?

Which model have you seen keep customers around longer and convert them into paying ones? Keen to hear about what’s worked for you or any insights you’ve got!

Your startup isn’t competing with coders, marketers, or recruiters. 
You’re competing with Swiss Army knives. 
 
The brutal truth: 
 
Great engineers fail because they can’t sell. 
Great marketers fail because they can’t lead. 
Great ‘visionaries’ fail because they can’t recruit. 
 
Full-stack founders win by mastering 5 skills: 
 
Recruiting → Hire A-players before you have funding. 
Example: “The founder who closed a Seed round with a cold LinkedIn DM.” 
 
Storytelling → Turn jargon into “Why should I care?” 
Stat: Startups with strong narratives raise 3x faster. 
 
Systems → Build processes that scale without you. 
Trap: “Hustle culture” kills 60% of startups by Year 3. 
 
Speed → Ship fast, fix faster. Perfection is bankruptcy. 
 
Stamina → Outlast rivals who quit after 3 rejections. 
 
How to start: 
 
Audit your weakest skill today. (Is it hiring? Pitching? Code reviews?)

It's 1 technical, 1 non-technical founder, and they're looking for their first engineer, offering 6.5% equity.

My assumptions are:

* $1-20B TAM
* 6.5% equity diluted to 2-3% by exit
* 5-10% market share if wildly successful
* 10x revenue multiple at exit

This pencils out to $10-$600M. The higher end of the TAM is pretty risky though, so maybe $10-30M is a ""safer"" estimate.

This doesn't seem like a good deal compared to the FANG job, especially if it takes 5-10 years to reach $100M ARR, even if they do get there.

Both are amazing goals. You get the latter (independence) by starting something at all, so there's less variability in that outcome. On the other hand, generating wealth... that's SO hard to do.

The thinking goes that starting a startup is potentially a path to great wealth. It totally is - when it works - which it rarely does. So if the goal is wealth exclusively, we'd have to compare the upside and variability of that outcome to getting a job.

While the job may not sound too sexy, the certainty of it over a comparable period of time (let's use a 10 year horizon because in my experience that's how long it takes to make a startup truly successful) is what folks overlook.

There are two places we get screwed when we try to build wealth with a startup - the first 0-5 years when we get paid next to nothing, and the ""debt"" we incur by not being paid while in most cases, taking on a ton of actual debt. So not only are we not adding to our coffers, we're building a massive sinkhole toward ever refilling them.

It's not that getting a job will definitely pay more, it's that creating a substantial ""hole"" in our financial future to dig out of may prevent us from growing at all. Most folks are not equipped to take that gamble and lose, and that's perfectly normal.

I’m looking for some advice and feedback. We’ve developed a tool that makes it easy to share services running on a local computer with others. Think of it as similar to ngrok but with a user-friendly interface and some additional features.

For instance, if you’re working on a website and want someone to review it quickly, you can use this tool to generate a public URL in just a few clicks. It’s not limited to websites, you can also share databases, APIs, or even game servers.

We’ve also integrated it with Docker, so you can easily expose and share services running inside containers.

Now, the big question: how do we reach developers and find our target audience? The tool is completely free right now, we’re not trying to monetize it. What we really need is feedback and input to validate our ideas and guide future development.

I've talked with a lot of potential cofounders from YC but nobody seems to commit to help me develop this  (as it would take 4 months full time to develop it or more part time). So one option now is to raise money and hire a CTO.

I have a meeting with a potential investor later today that is serious. I already talked on the phone with him yesterday. He asked how much from MY money I'm willing to invest and I said around 10k from my savings. He said he would provide 90k and then asked how much for the equity split and I said ""ideally would be 50-50 between him and I"" . He said that's impossible because he would be taking most of the risk. However I will not be working another job, and I will be full time dedicated on this without taking a salary.

What would be a fair split here?

UPDATE: His offer is 20% for me and 80% for him. He will inject 90k into the startup and I will put 10k

However he said in a future round he could inject more money and my percentage will not be diluted , I will still stay at 20% and there will be a buy back clause that would let me buy shares from the startups profit.

UPDATE 2: I tried to renegotiate and asked to have an agreement when the MVP is done but he refused. He said if you have a product you will be in a different position.

Some startups are really interesting, but along with all the attention they deserve due to the value they create for society, working for them can be a bit challenging. Some startups may not have enough funding and are in the process of fundraising. They might not have sufficient resources in hand but still need employees to get things done; otherwise, they won’t secure funding at all—makes sense? Also, most of the companies we get services from now were once startups, right? So, I’m thinking there must be ways to handle these kinds of situations where startups say, “Work unpaid for a few months, then we’ll get funding and pay you.” Does anything come to mind about how that might work out?

Here are my other questions:

1. Is it possible to sign an official contract, even while being unpaid, that outlines all the facts and details, including the amount of money one might receive later or an exact payment date?
2. What else, in general, should be included in the contract, considering the job is a remote software engineering position?
3. How do they even track that you’re working the number of hours you promised?
4. Do people need to include details of their projects in the contract?

I am also aware that companies can simply dump you and not pay you at all even if you had singed a contract, or they simply may stop operating, but for the sake of the converstaion, let's not consider that scenario.

We are still in the process of building an MVP, talking to customers about our iterations of prototypes and trying to get the first few sales. We haven't raised and are bootstrapped currently but are considering maybe doing an angel round, mainly to hire help for either marketing or an extra engineer.

  
I've been urging my cofounder to be more active on LinkedIn and post more regularly but they haven't been very consistent with it.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d1f1,1i6nocj,"After talking to 1000s of Founders for 30 years, here's *why* think most people should just ""get a job"" (I will not promote)","Quick backstory and bias - I'm a 9x Founder that helps over 1 million other Founders at my company.  It's my dream to help anyone in the world become a Founder.  So my \*bias\* here may seem like it's leaning toward everyone building startups, but my \*experience\* in working with so many Founders tells me otherwise.

Most Founders launch a startup for two primary reasons - to create wealth, and to have some level of independence.  Both are amazing goals.  You get the latter (independence) by starting something at all, so there's less variability in that outcome.  On the other hand, generating wealth... that's SO hard to do.

The thinking goes that starting a startup is potentially a path to great wealth.  It totally is - when it works - which it rarely does.  So if the goal is wealth exclusively, we'd have to compare the upside and variability of that outcome to getting a job.

While the job may not sound too sexy, the certainty of it over a comparable period of time (let's use a 10 year horizon because in my experience that's how long it takes to make a startup truly successful) is what folks overlook.

There are two places we get screwed when we try to build wealth with a startup - the first 0-5 years when we get paid next to nothing, and the ""debt"" we incur by not being paid while in most cases, taking on a ton of actual debt.

One could understand when startups fail due to a severe paucity of funds. A lot of great ideas (or what could might have been groundbreaking solutions) did not even see the light of day because there's just no money to pursue those ideas.

As a startup trying to get that MVP up, I can say the struggle has been more than real. Agencies ask outrageous amounts, and technical co-founders are unicorns.

However, what I cannot understand as a newbie to the startup game is why many startups FAIL, having raised millions upon millions and been valuated as billion-dollar companies. Only to then...simply fail...and to never be heard of again. Could this be a mismanagement issue, straight incompetence, or those startups were designed as scams from go?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d1f5,1i6la3f,Networking on LinkedIn is “DEAD” And AI is what killed it…. “I will not promote”," 


Quick disclaimer, I for one love AI, and I think it’s definitely going to change the future of work for the better.

However, THIS isn’t what I had in mind (check out the screenshots in the comments below)

So last Thursday morning, I got a random connection request which of course I accepted, because… networking, right?

Now, that same Thursday afternoon, I got this huge ass message 

Something about some crazy superstar senior designer wanting to get hired…

They're the kind of _“GAME-CHANGER”_ companies are fighting for! (👀tfff… yeah right)

Come Friday morning, I get back onto linkedIn and the same lady sends me one of the worst follow ups I've ever seen in my life, with an opening that starts…

""Hope your day is going as smoothly as a well-executed user flow! 🎨""

Like who tf talks like this?

So I simply replied “man pls shush”...

Now before anyone roasts me for this, I was feeling a bit sassy so that's why i went with that.

But then this guy decide to get to me with a whole ass essay about ""valuing my time"" and ""taking a more considerate approach""

And that’s when it clicked— *I'm talking to AI.* 

This is literally what LinkedIn has now become: An AI networking platform.

With AI talking and making deals with other AI…

Bots apologizing to bots…

And no real people actually reading or interacting with one another.

It’s absolute insanity.

And to think that companies are out here spending thousands of dollars on AI tools that are basically just spam machines with better grammar…

Thinking that they’re “scaling their efforts” when THIS is the quality we’ve got.

Imo, linkedin might honestly be dead at this point, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we’ve moved away from it… UNLESS we got a huge course correct.

Now if you’re someone using AI for linkedin. This is probably what your ""optimized outreach"" looks like to your prospects. 

Anywho…

I'd love to hear from you guys too:

What are some of the weirdest outreach messages you’ve gotten?

And what do you think about the future of AI personalised outreach?

Extra points if you've also gotten “a day as smooth as a well-executed user flow.” 💀

1. Execution Matters, But Ideas Matter More

Yes, execution is crucial, but great ideas are what change the world. A powerful idea doesn’t need perfect execution to start—it needs the right problem-solving vision.

2. This Narrative Keeps the Power in the Hands of the Few

The focus on execution feeds into a system that benefits a select group of people—those who already have the resources and networks. Newcomers are told they need a perfect background or the “right” co-founder to succeed, reinforcing conformity over true innovation.

3. Innovation Doesn’t Come from Copying

The startup world is filled with copycat businesses. True disruption happens when you challenge the status quo, think differently, and take risks to solve real problems.

4. The Idea is Where the Power Lies

Ideas are the backbone of any business. You don’t need to be a tech expert to bring a great idea to life—tools and resources are there to help you execute, no matter your background.

5. The Shift is Happening

The rise of no-code and low-code tools is breaking down barriers. Now, anyone with a good idea can execute it. Innovation is no longer gated by who has the technical expertise.

Bottom Line:
The emphasis on execution is holding us back. Great ideas can come from anywhere, and it’s time to value vision over perfection. If you’ve got a bold idea, don’t be afraid to challenge the norm and make it happen.",startups,1737465095.0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i6i95u/the_execution_over_idea_narrative_is_holding/

From the interns’ perspective, it’s a win-win: they gain tons of hands-on experience working in a dynamic environment, learn directly from experienced engineers, and contribute to meaningful projects—all at a relatively low cost for the startup. Of course, there’s some time investment needed to onboard and mentor them, but the payoff could be significant for both sides.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d20d,1i5uh92,Serious B2B businesses will not try to create a solution using AI - This is why. [i will not promote],"After architecting and developing multiple B2B SaaS platforms and resolving countless challenges, here's why I don't think a proper B2B solution can be developed using AI. 

You must have senior tech-folks in your teams - even if you choose to leverage AI for expediting some code generation. This isn't theory - this is battle-tested reality. You can use this as a template if you're building one.

Core Considerations:

1. Multi-Tenancy Foundation (B2B)

* Proper tenant isolation at every layer (data, compute, networking)
* Flexible deployment models (pooled vs. silo) based on customer tier
* Tenant-aware everything (logging, metrics, tracing)

1. Identity &amp; Security (B2B/Standalone)

* Enterprise-grade authentication, often with SSO support
* Role-based access control (RBAC) at tenant level (may need dynamic policy generation for resource access)
* Audit trails for all system actions (specially if you're in a regulated domain)

1. Client/Tenant Management (B2B)

* Self-service onboarding with admin approval workflows
* Automated tenant provisioning/deprovisioning
* Tenant-specific configurations and customizations
* Cross-tenant analytics and administration

1. Operational Excellence (B2B/Standalone)

* Zero-downtime deployments (helps with canary releases)
* Tenant-isolated debugging capabilities
* Resource quotas and throttling by tenant tier
* Automated backup and disaster recovery per tenant

1. Scalability Architecture (B2B)

* Independent scaling of tenant workloads
* Resource isolation for ""noisy neighbor"" prevention
* Tier-based performance guarantees (SLAs)
* Dynamic resource allocation

Each of these topics can be as complicated as you can think of - depends on the solution you're building. I have seen many seasoned architects and developers struggle also because of their ""single-tenant"" mindset. 

Here are some common pitfalls to avoid (B2B/Standalone):

* Standalone - mindset in database design
* Hard-coded configurations
* Lack of context in logging/monitoring
* Insufficient tenant isolation in shared services (B2B)
* Missing tenant-aware cost allocation  (B2B)

You need people great with infrastructure as well. They need to consider:

* Tenant-aware routing (API Gateway or whatever you're using)
* Code with isolation when/if required
* Data storage with proper partitioning
* Shared services vs. dedicated services strategy

There are a number of common problems I have seen people often make. Often it's because of a pressure from high above. But every architectural decision must considered in terms of the solution you're building. In many cases, security cannot be bolted on later, observability must be tenant-aware from day one, operations must scale.

This is just the foundation. Your actual business logic sits ON TOP of all this.

Now, would you think these can be done by AI? I'll be waiting for that day. :-)

I have embarked on the path of becoming a developer, specifically in backend development, after completing a specialization course. However, I have some concerns regarding working within a team, particularly the potential risk of other members taking over the project. Since they could simply copy the source code from our local repository on GitHub—or by any other means—within the group, they could potentially claim the project for themselves.

I understand that a team member cannot prevent me from accessing the source code; this is not the issue I am addressing. The concern lies in the possibility that a team member could commercialize the project without the involvement of the other members, provided they have the necessary resources, such as marketing or investors. In such a scenario, they could potentially form contracts without our consent, secure 100% ownership, and launch the project in the market. Even though the source code may still reside with the other members, the commercialization could already be underway, leaving the rest of us powerless to intervene.

For the past decade mobile apps were a core element of daily life for entertainment, productivity and connectivity. However, as the ecosystem saturated the general desire to download ""just one more app"" became apprehensive. There were clear monopolistic winners in different categories, such as Instagram and TikTok, which completely captured the majority of people's screentime.

The golden age of creating indie apps and becoming a millionaire from them was dead.

Conceptual models of these popular apps became ingrained in the general consciousness, and downloading new apps where re-learning new UI layouts was required, became a major friction point. There is high reluctance to download a new app rather than just utilizing the tooling of the growing market share of the existing winners.

Content marketing and white labeled apps saw a resurgence of new app downloads, as users with parasympathetic relationships with influencers could be more easily persuaded to download them. However, this has led to a series of genericized tooling that lacks the soul of the early indie developer apps from the 2010s (Flappy bird comes to mind).

A seemingly grim spot to be in, until everything changed on November 30th 2022. Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever and team announced chatGPT, a Large Language Model that was the first publicly available generative AI tool. The first non-deterministic tool that could reason probablisitically in a similar (if flawed) way, to the human mind.

At first, it was a clear paradigm shift in the world of computing, this was obvious from the fact that it climbed to 1 Million users within the first 5 days of its launch. However, despite the insane hype around the AI, its utility was constrained to chatbot interfaces for another year or more. As the models reasoning abilities got better and better, engineers began to look for other ways of utilizing this new paradigm shift, beyond chatbots.

It became clear that, despite the powerful abilities to generate responses to prompts, the LLMs suffered from false hallucinations with extreme confidence, significantly impacting the reliability of their use, in search, coding and general utility.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) was coined to provide a solution to this. Now, the LLM would apply a traditional search for data, via a database, a browser or other source of truth, and then feed that information into the prompt as it generates, allowing for more accurate results.

Furthermore, it became clear that you could enhance an LLM by providing them metadata to interact with tools such as APIs for other services, allowing LLMs to perform actions typically reserved for humans, like fetching data, manipulating it and acting as an independent Agent.

This prompted engineers to start treating LLMs, not as a database and a search engine, but rather a reasoning system, that could be part of a larger system of inputs and feedback to handle workflows independently.

These ""AI Agents"" are poised to become the core technology in the next few years for hyper-personalizing and automating processes for specific users. Rather than having a generic B2B SaaS product that is somewhat useful for a team, one could standup a modular system of Agents that can handle the exactly specified workflow for that team.  Frameworks such as LlangChain and LLamaIndex will help enable this for companies worldwide.

The power is back in the hands of the people.

However, it's not just big tech that is going to benefit from this revolution. AI Agentic workflows will allow for a resurgence in personalized applications that work like personal digital employee's. One could have a Personal Finance agent keeping track of their budgets, a Personal Trainer accountability coaching you making sure you meet your goals, or even a silly companion that roasts you when you're procrastinating. The options are endless !

At the core of this technology is the fact that these agents will be able to recall all of your previous data and actions, so they will get better at understanding you and your needs as a function of time.

We are at the beginning of an exciting period in history, and I'm looking forward to this new period of deeply personalized experiences.

* We pretend we need more data (while avoiding real customer calls)

I'm a 19-year-old male studying Electronics and Instrumentation in a Tier-2 engineering college. While my academic path is technical, I’ve always been interested in startups and entrepreneurship. Here's a bit about my journey so far:

 

* Tech Journey: I started learning coding in my first year of college to explore opportunities in the tech world. Currently, I’m at a beginner level and landed an internship as a frontend developer in Bangalore (through a connection, my dad's close friend). I’ve also enrolled in Angela Yu’s full-stack development course to improve my skills.

 

* Non-Tech Interests: Recently, I’ve been curious about non-technical roles in companies. I feel that coding is challenging for me, and I’m wondering if my skills and interests align better with non-tech roles like product management, operations, or business development.

 

* Startup Knowledge: I’ve spent time learning about startups through resources like Y Combinator and have gained intermediate knowledge in areas like equity, finance, and the general startup ecosystem.

 

I’m from Tamil Nadu (near Chennai), and I want to explore non-tech jobs further and understand the skills I need to build a roadmap for my career. Ultimately, my goal is to achieve my dream of running my own startup.

 

My Questions:

1. What are some non-technical roles I can explore as a fresher, and what skills should I focus on?
2. How can I decide whether to stick with tech or transition to non-tech?
3. Any tips on balancing learning tech and exploring non-tech skills while in college?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d22d,1i4z192,All in one Therapists platform,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice as I work on building a platform for therapists and their patients. The idea is to make it easier for therapists to manage everything related to their clients while also giving patients helpful tools to track their progress and stay engaged with therapy.

The platform bridges the gap between therapists and patients with web and mobile apps (iOS and Android) that use AI to create a seamless experience. Therapists will play the leading role in guiding the patient’s journey, and, with the patient’s consent, they can access all the data the patient shares through the app.

# Key Features

For Therapists:

* Session Management: Easily schedule, track, and manage client sessions.
* Patient Insights: AI-driven analysis to track progress and identify trends.
* Content Library: Ready-to-use exercises and tools to support therapy sessions.
* Billing &amp; Payments: Automated invoicing and secure payment processing.
* Secure Messaging: Encrypted communication for ongoing support.

For Patients:

* Progress Tracking: Visual tools to track progress and set goals with their therapist.
* Journaling &amp; Reflections: Guided prompts to reflect on emotions and experiences.
* Session Notes: Access to summaries and resources shared by their therapist.
* Appointment Management: Easy scheduling and reminders for sessions.
* AI Guidance: Personalized suggestions based on mood and history.

For Both:

* Confidentiality: HIPAA-compliant and designed with privacy in mind.
* Mobile-First Design: Full functionality across both web and mobile apps.

This platform simplifies the work therapists do behind the scenes while empowering patients to stay actively involved in their mental health journey. It’s all about making therapy more effective, connected, and accessible for everyone involved.

Our product is a **web-based compute platform** that allows users to run high-performance applications and games seamlessly on any device, regardless of local hardware or platform compatibility.

# The Problem &amp; Solution

**The way we interact with applications today is broken.** Low-end devices can’t handle demanding applications, leaving millions of users out of the equation. Even for those who can afford better devices, cross-platform compatibility issues (e.g., running Windows apps on Linux/Mac or vice versa) make the experience frustrating and inefficient.

Virtual machines, often seen as a workaround, are expensive, complex to set up, and require a steep learning curve—further limiting accessibility for everyday users.

Our product aims to redefine how people interact with applications—by removing the barriers created by hardware, software limitations, and the shortcomings of traditional solutions like VMs.

# Progress So Far

* Built a working **MVP** and onboarded **1,000+ beta registrations**.
* Secured **paid pilots** with leading institutes in India.
* Raised **$50k+ in grants** and convertible notes ($4M cap, flexible terms).
* Gained **$200k in cloud infrastructure credits**.
* Represented India at the **world's largest student entrepreneurship competition** organised by Princeton University

# The Roadblock

We’re currently raising a **$500k seed round**, but no VC in India is willing to invest in a new tech category like ours. Most are asking for more traction, even after acknowledging the complexity of our deep-tech product and validating the problem it solves.

We’ve approached over 50 VCs, but the feedback is often:

* ""We love the product, but let’s see more traction.""
* ""It’s too early for us to commit.""
* ""Can you show a similar business model validated in any other country?""

This is incredibly frustrating, as  proper commercialization would be very difficult without the capital we’re seeking to raise.

# Considering a Move to the US

Given the challenges in India, I’ve been contemplating moving to the US, where the market for our product is much larger and VCs might have a better understanding of deep tech investments. However, I’m unsure if this is the right move or how to go about it. I don’t have a clear catalyst, financial backing or pathway for making this transition (I satisfy the qualifications for O1 Visa)  
  
**Ask for Advice**

I’ve poured two years of hard work into building this product, solving a genuinely difficult problem. Yet, despite our progress, we’ve hit a wall in fundraising, and it feels like we’re stuck in limbo.

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or has experience in fundraising for deep-tech startups, especially in markets like India or the US.

* **How do I convince investors to take a bet on a new tech category?**
* Are there other funding options I should explore?
* Is moving to the US a viable strategy, and if so, how do I approach it?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d231,1i4t0c6,"Well, I am trying to enter the Startup Industry and would like some mentorship to know if I am doing things right.","I’m a 17-year-old boy from India. I initially wanted to pursue engineering, but my parents—particularly my father, who is a doctor—insisted that I pursue medicine instead. In India, after the 10th grade, students choose their stream for grades 11 and 12. The main options are Science (subdivided into Physics, Chemistry, and Biology for medical aspirants, or Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics for engineering aspirants), Commerce, and Humanities. I wanted to take PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) to pursue engineering, but under pressure from my parents, I was forced into PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology).

In India, eligibility for medical school requires PCB (for the NEET exam), while PCM is required for the engineering entrance exam (JEE). Since I was enrolled in PCB, JEE was no longer an option for me, leaving NEET as the only path.

The system here often involves students enrolling in ""dummy schools,"" where attendance and marks are managed “illegally” while students focus entirely on private coaching classes, which are exorbitantly expensive. I was sent to an offline coaching center, which turned out to be one of the worst experiences of my life. The management was dismissive of complaints, and students who reported issues often faced retaliation. I was deeply depressed during this time, and although my parents noticed, they did nothing. For nine months, I barely spoke to anyone except my best friend, who had moved to another city to prepare for JEE. He helped me through a severe depression and even prevented a potential suicide attempt.

In 2024, I stopped attending the coaching classes and told my parents they were closed for the final three months of the academic year due to school exams. This gave me some temporary relief, but when coaching resumed in April 2024, I decided to quit. I convinced my parents to let me study online, which was far more effective. However, the problem remained: I was still preparing for something I had no passion for. Eventually, I stopped studying altogether.

In August 2024, I joined YC Co-Founder Matching after coming up with an idea for a company specializing in selling pre-built small form factor (SFF) PCs. These PCs offer the same performance as full-sized ones but are three times smaller. I believed this concept had significant potential and started working on it daily. In November 2024, I found a collaborator who could provide valuable input.

However, after running profit calculations, I realized that the consumer segment for SFF PCs would not be profitable enough. I pivoted the idea to focus on enterprise-grade systems, where higher pricing and margins are viable without compromising the customer base.

The challenge now is that my parents are unaware of this venture because I know they would discourage me from pursuing it. I want to move forward with this idea and discuss it with an experienced individual who can mentor me.

My interest in technology began when I was 13, after building a vending machine using a single-board computer and automating it. In 2021, I participated in an international drone competition, securing first place. This led to opportunities to work on UAV projects with the Abu Dhabi Government and the University of Fujairah. My passion for technology also extended to PCs. I gained knowledge through forums and channels, helping over 5,000 people online, and worked at a local computer shop assembling and repairing over 70 workstations.

After everything I’ve experienced—from the struggles of being forced into an undesired path to discovering my passion for tech—I started researching this field for a startup in August 2024. I’m now at a crossroads and would greatly benefit from guidance from a mentor to help me carve a clear path forward.",startups,1737270891.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i4t0c6/well_i_am_trying_to_enter_the_startup_industry/

**Many new founders come onto this subreddit and ask, ""What do you think about my idea?""**

I see this as a common mistake, but I understand why it happens. We all seek validation, but the danger is where and how we get it. Cognitive biases, like confirmation bias, are killers, especially for first-time founders. However, I've also seen some pretty harsh and irrelevant responses that would deter any new founder.

The fact is, none of us have any idea unless we're your target user. How would we, as startup founders, know if you have a new AI co-pilot for HR recruiting? You'll only get our opinion, and on Reddit, most of us think our opinions are correct even though there's stuff we don't know we don't know. You're only going to get confused or waste your time. And yes, this includes asking on the startup ideas subreddit.

While it's okay to get started somewhere, here are the questions you should be asking:

* Who should I ask about my startup idea?
* Where could I find them, or how should I go about it?
* How should I ask them, especially starting with their problems?
* What should I look for or avoid, such as leading questions?
* How did you or others do it, and what did you learn?

I wish founders would ask me these questions more often instead of, ""Do you think my startup is a good idea?"" Whenever a founder asks me that, I say, ""I have no idea. Have you asked your target users?"" Of course, I have opinions, but those should be taken with massive heaps of salt. Then, we can discuss productive stuff like customer discovery and reading books like ""The Mom Test.""

The reality is that if you, as a new founder, are not willing to talk to real humans who represent the target user with the problem you're trying to solve, you won't be a very good founder.

✅ **Cost Savings:** Our method requires significantly less energy, raw materials, and manpower, cutting costs by up to \[insert %\].  
✅ **Unparalleled Purity &amp; Safety:** Advanced genetic analysis ensures the highest safety and efficacy standards.

**Why this matters:** Traditional methods produce only 1 gram of toxin from 1 liter of culture. With our innovation, we not only streamline the process but also make this extraordinary product more accessible globally. A mere 5 nanograms of botulinum toxin equals 200 million doses — think of the scalability and impact!

**The Opportunity:**  
I am looking to connect with investors, biotech experts, and forward-thinking companies interested in partnering to bring this technology to market. This isn't just a business opportunity — it's a chance to redefine an industry standard and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders.

If you’re intrigued, I’d love to discuss this further. Feel free to comment here or send me a direct message for more details. Together, we can take this innovation global!

Back in 2014, I was a solo technical founder who'd bootstrapped a healthcare SaaS to about $6k monthly revenue. Like many first-time founders, I realized I needed help with sales, so I decided to bring on a cofounder.

Things started okay. We were both learning the ropes - me figuring out product development, him learning B2B sales. He managed to double our revenue, but we were still struggling to find real product-market fit.

We actually had a decent working relationship. Until one day...

He tells me he's leaving for a new venture and wants to cash out his 30% equity. Here's where it gets wild - after consulting with a lawyer, he was absolutely convinced the company was worth 3x our annual revenue. Do the math: he wanted me to pay him tens of thousands for his share. While I was barely covering server costs and basic bills.

He kept insisting it was ""a great deal"" for me. Instead of arguing, I just hit him with:

""If it's such a great deal, I'll sell you my 70% at the exact same valuation. You can have the whole company.""

The look on his face? Priceless. 

Suddenly his ""expert valuation"" didn't seem so solid when he had to be the buyer. Funny how that works.

End result: Settled for $4k and legal fees to keep things clean and professional. Both moved on.

Lessons learned:
- Sometimes the best negotiation tactic is just flipping the script
- Paper valuations mean nothing without a real buyer
- Always have a clean exit process in your agreements
- Keep it professional, even when things get tense

For those dealing with similar situations - remember that a reality check can be your best tool. Sometimes you just need to hold up a mirror.

For example, if you need legal advice from a lawyer for a small issue and don't want to go anywhere, you can book an appointment with the lawyer for just one hour, paying only for that hour. This would apply to all professionals in various categories, such as Health and Wellness, Legal and Financial, Education and Careers, Technology, etc.

* 40%+ use the extension for more than 1 job applying session
* 20%+ use the extension for more than 7 job applying sessions
* Avg 5+ applications submitted per active user

These are focused on proving the product provides real value and users want to incorporate it into their job searching routine.

# Plan to accomplish this:

* Hope to be able to get majority of traffic from a subreddit I have been growing in the job applying space r /jobhopping
* Build in public on X and tiktok (if ban gets delayed)
* Reddit commenting in other subreddits

# My concerns:

* This is definitely the most bare bones project I've ever released, it's usable and when it works it really works quite well, but there are some pretty big bugs
* The current state requires no login, and no payment info, just a resume. This requires the user to provide their own OpenAI api key. I think for some this is a plus but for most this will be a deal-breaker from trying the product.
* Metric numbers are completely pulled out of my ass, I believe they are ambitious and make sense in terms of proving value, but I'm not sure what numbers I should really be striving for.
   * What I believe is much more likely is the numbers will be heavily skewed towards the top 5% of users, the power users will account for over 50% of the volume. I think at the end of the validation phase my numbers will fall short but this skew will be present, so what really proves validation? Should I disregard the volume of users and focus on the top 50 users?

# Bigger picture:

This next month phase is purely focused on talking with users and proving there is a desirable value prop here. If I can prove people want this I'm planning to build a true v1 of the product. Before money I'd really like to just be able to build a small group of people that genuinely find the product useful and are daily active users.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d249,1i40n77," AI in software development - realistically, it can be a force multiplier, but not a replacement","I'm a software engineer and architect for 24y. Was actively using AI in my development work last few weeks, mostly experimentation. I wanted to share my honest experience here as many are continuously arguing about how awesome/bad it is. 

There's been a lot of doom and gloom about AI **replacing** developers... specially on social media. Mostly lies. 

Here's the thing - AI cannot replace mid/above developers, not yet. It frequently forgets the context, even for a tiny application with 3 classes. You can remind it, using lots of tokens (more money), but almost every time the output is going to be different... and needs massive amount of fixing - which mostly an experienced person can handle properly. Now, after you take care of that, you're not gonna let AI touch it again... you get the point.

What it can do however, is become a good(not great, yet) force multiplier. In my experience, it can make a small team more productive, especially in the initial stages of development. Say, a 2-person senior dev team using AI effectively can now handle workloads that previously required 4-5 people (typically 2 senior + 2-3 junior/mid-level devs). 

Generally, don't expect it to do the following (I would grade them 0-3 out of 10, currently) :

* Understand complex business requirements
* Design system architecture
* Debug tricky issues
* Make critical technical decisions
* Ensure code quality and maintainability 

Bottom line: It's making some changes into how we work... but it's more like having autocomplete on steroids rather than a replacement for developers. It can make good/sr. developers more efficient, but cannot make them obsolete. Not yet.

","I work for a utility energy startup, we site and develop utility scale energy infrastructure around the US.  Proven technology and business model.  I knew nothing about startups or this industry 3 years ago but was hired from the Fed gov and have been promoted 3 times in 3 years.  

The CEO is highly emotional, traps the company on multi hour calls to rant and rave about China, us not working hard enough, cold calling team members for minute details on projects and berating them
when they can’t get to their spreadsheet fast enough.  We got yelled at for being offline on Christmas Day, “the big firms work through the holidays because they have discipline!”.

There are no other executives in the company, no one has power but the CEO.  I do have huge autonomy to do my job, and I travel well for work. 

All of my performance bonuses have 4y clawbacks, you’re not allowed to take cash bonuses at EOY because it’s disloyal and the CEO will call you and ask if you’re managing your own finances appropriately and offer to give you his own money - so that you take the equity.  He recently fired 3/4 of the engineering team - they all had equity that was forfeited. 

I’ve only got the equity that was awarded at hiring, 10,000 of 6M units.  You’re not allowed to ask for more, and the narrative was that you’d get more with promotion and success - I’ve been promoted 3 times and have increased our valuation by at least $40MM just via tax incentives. 

Recently, he said he’d start giving out equity again because it’s been years and he was uncomfortable with “quitters” owning a piece of his company - we were issued dense contracts for “performance units “ that are a diluted derivative of the equity Co. 

The narrative is that he’s waiting until we sell to assign equity, and at that last moment he’ll allocate “generational wealth” upon his trusted employees who should be honored to work for him anyway.  

I love my team, I love my projects, I’m so burned out that I can’t see straight.  The first year he did issue $100ks of claw-back-able cash bonuses, then stopped and like a bad relationship parter, trapped us with golden handcuffs - mines all invested and growing, but it’s still a gut punch to quit and lose it.  

Has anyone experienced this side of startups?  We have the trust of BIG name PE backers and are going back to market soon.  80/20 that anyone is getting a $MM+ payout - even though he promised me single digits and he’s made +/- $30MM over our last funding rounds.  

I know I need to either quit or just ride it out and hope for the best.  I’m fried with burnout and can’t imagine looking for a new job right now.

* Working on a SaaS startup with a team of 5
* Founded 3 companies prior with decent outcomes
* Most recently, I helped in building a recently acquired **$150Mn** startup from scratch

For the last few months, I have been working on my startup and have subconsciously started relying a lot more on generic AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude. For the initial, basic research it works fine, but off-late, I have been validating almost every decision (Eg. Pricing, Unique insights, can't mention others) with them and it has been largely a hit-or-miss experience. More misses than hits lately.

With the kind of non-business-oriented, generic, and repetitive response I kept getting, I snapped out of it for now. But it left me wondering a couple of thoughts:

1. Are other founders also relying so heavily on these tools?
2. If yes, are you getting tangible value out of it?
3. What are the issues you have noticed with these tools?
   * For me, no context is the biggest one, repetitive generic answers and people-pleasing behavior are the others. It should be more like a partner.
4. If we really have to use AI to help with Decision-making/Strategic insights, shouldn't there be a specialized assistant or copilot for this purpose?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d252,1i3pe0l,How does your startup help journalists?,"It's rare that you just message a journalist and say ""hey I made this app please cover it"" and they excitedly agree. However, being a journalist is hard today:

* AI written articles.
* High demands for hyper niche SEO friendly content.
* Lots of competition, especially at higher levels.
* Etc.

So when you can do their job for them or give them a really good starting point, it makes them very receptive to running your article.

## What do you have that a journalist wants? 

Look at your data and decide what might make a good high traffic article. Sometimes it's easy, such as you had commissioned a study and it came back with interesting results. Sometimes you need to be creative: I once was working on a project that evaluated Overwatch footage, so during Overwatch League's big championship I asked the engineers if we could point the analysis tools at the live game footage and evaluate the biggest plays. Our tool evaluated the plays, pulled the footage, and then we could send a list of journalists who cover Overwatch 10 Biggest Plays of OWL Week One or 10 Dumbest Team Kills, etc. We created a list (I'll explain below) and gave each one a slightly modified unique list that that can run. 

Actually, in Overwatch anther example is we noticed that one map wasn't in the rotation for a competitive season. As we were collecting live data from members on each match they play we could identify ""yes, this map was removed from rotation"" so we sent some journalists our finding along with our guesses as to why it was pulled. We just used the data we already had and packaged it up.

Whatever your startup is, I'm sure we can find something interesting that can be shared. Bonus points for timely content.

## Compile a list of journalists

I'm a pretty avid news reader as it is so this comes easy for me. Any time you see a news article that deals with your niche look up who wrote that article. Create a spreadsheet or put them in your CRM, note the last time you messaged them, maybe a rating about how good their writing is / news sites they have access to, and number of articles they have published for you. 

Reach out whenever you can find something relevant to them, ask them if there's anything they are looking for, and cultivate that relationship. 

## tl;dr

You've likely got unique access to some kind of data. Spend a little time evaluating what articles could make use of that data. Find journalists and send them that data.

One time I sent a Newsroom a pizza and had the pizza company write something funny on the inside of the box like ""no one knows about my cool product so I'm stuck resorting to making friends with pizza"" and someone gave us a shout for it.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d254,1i3nsql,Here's how I found my cofounder.,"I had the idea, I had enough skills, and I had a version that was at least somewhat functional.

But I couldn’t keep making headway by myself. Time is the eternal enemy of the mortal. It was time to bring in reinforcements.

One friend had told me to sign up for the YC Startup School, which I did, and was working through their curricula. YC strongly emphasizes the importance of a cofounder.

I didn’t have a cofounder for any of my last startups except one, who was my girlfriend at the time, which is I’d… not recommend. The cofounder gap was another miss on the checklist of patterns to match to improve my chances of success.

I signed up for YC cofounder matching, and cranked through profiles to see who could be a good candidate. But I don’t really like meeting people online. It’s a real crapshoot. I love the internet but it poisons a lot of people’s brains, and it’s too easy to be false. I took calls and met some great people. While I was visiting SF, I met a few in person. None I’d make an offer to as a cofounder, more for a divergence between what they wanted to build than as a statement of their capabilities.

So I started calling friends again, asking them who would be a good cofounder. I got a bunch of referrals and started interviewing them. One friend pointed me to Wes.

I talked to Wes a few times and found he’d had three prior companies over the last 20 years. He said they’d never taken venture investment, which was a good sign - anyone that can build and exit multiple companies over decades without professional investment has a grasp of what a company takes to survive.

And within a talk or two, Wes had started to stand up his own version of the project, which was another really good sign.

One of the first things that he said was that a client-hosted solution would take too much work to turn on, for an MVP we needed something that clients could turn on in a few minutes without any effort. Wes suggested that we move to a CDN model with a reverse proxy, and build the Docker as the proxy.

Turning on the CDN would only take a few minutes of DNS changes for anyone to set up. And we could still deploy the container directly into the client environment, so client-hosted was still an option.

He suggested we move to away from our fixed-location defined-server host and into fly.io, a serverless cloud host. That we move to a monorepo so we could build all the elements of the app inside the same repo. That we automate our build and deploy process through Github actions. That we implement a tracking pixel for initial data collection so people could taste-test the analytics without having to turn over their routing to us.

I could go on, but the point was that Wes had the credentials, experience, and motivation to jump right in and start putting together the stuff we needed to take the demo from something “working” on my system into something that was alive on the internet.

Following the guidance from YC Startup School and Founder Matchmaking, I offered Wes the cofounder role with 50% equity split and a 4-year vesting schedule (1 year cliff, 3 year monthly).

I have my own twist, though - I always do a 12-week evaluation period. That means either of us can break away in the first 3 months for any reason or no reason, no harm done, no hard feelings. We have a 3-week check-in to make sure we’re still aligned, then a 6-week check-in, and a 12-week check-in. If we make it past all three without any serious concerns from either side, we move ahead with the formal engagement, backdating it to the start of the evaluation period.

I’ve done this for every executive, advisor, board member, employee, and contractor I’ve ever hired. It’s helped highlight issues early and avoid committing. It’s a great way to engage someone who you’ve not worked with before while making sure you have an escape hatch if needed.

For those keeping track at home, I organized the company in Apr ‘24, built my demo by Jun. Wes and I met in Jul and agreed to set Aug 1 as the start of the trial period. We set a presumptive date of Sept 1 for a working MVP.

Time is the greatest enemy of the mortal! Would our dear heroes prevail against all odds? Or would we be struck down?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d256,1i3mezo,"Stop the BS about AI, it cant even replace a developer with 3 months of experience","I just posted about this on LinkedIn, and I want to hear from you what you think, because everywhere I go I see AI glorified, on every social media platform.

This is the post : 

Stop the nonsense about AI

AI can’t even replace a developer with more than 3 months of experience.

Social media is blowing it out of proportion. I’ve tested AI tools myself with other senior developers, and let me tell you, they can’t even replace a developer with 3 months of experience. If they could, I’d be the first to use them in my agency. Instead of 30% profit, I’d make 50% or even 70%.

People don’t understand the difference between a beginner developer and an experienced **engineer**. Building a simple website with a form and authentication is not the same as creating a complex system that takes years of work and hundreds of skilled developers. It’s like watching a kid build a small wooden cabin and saying they can build a mansion.

This happened before with the internet. Everyone was hyped about useless things until the bubble burst, and then progress became steady. The same will happen with AI. Once people realize what AI can and cannot do, all the startups hiding behind the AI label without offering real value will fail. Customers will stop paying for anything labeled “AI” and think more carefully.

The hype is driven by influencers who want views and reactions, so they exaggerate. A simple video title like “I tested this new AI” turns into “AI will replace everyone by 2025.” Startups do the same to attract investors or users. They sell you something that isn’t there yet and call it “the next big thing”.

AI is a very great tech, I am not diminishing it ( I personally use it every day) but at the same time I am not trying to exaggerate it

PS:

The **dot-com bubble** (1995–2001) was a period of massive growth and speculation in internet-based companies. During this time, investors poured money into startups with “.com” in their names, assuming the internet would revolutionize everything overnight.",startups,1737136744.0,276,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i3mezo/stop_the_bs_about_ai_it_cant_even_replace_a/

My friend and I are considering starting a startup. Both of us have tech backgrounds—he works in the HFT industry, and I’ve been a founding software engineer at a startup that’s doing well. I work remotely from a small town in India, while my friend lives in another city.

For the past few weekends, we’ve been building a B2C web application. The idea requires funding to become fully functional as we can't afford resources like AI models on our own. Additionally, we’re unsure how to attract users for the app.

We applied to YC but missed the deadline and submitted a basic demo. While we didn’t get in, we were told we ranked in the top 10% of applications. Since then, we’ve refined the product significantly, but without funding, we’re unable to onboard users or improve the product further.

Now, we’re questioning whether a B2C product is the right approach. However, even with a B2B idea, the same issues persist—how do we attract customers, especially while working full-time jobs? Quitting our jobs isn’t an option until we have a clear path forward.

Here's what I planned so far:

1. Al-Powered Guidance(ChatGPT): The assistant would provide real-time help, similar to a step-by-step tutorial, tailored to the user's actions.

2. Target Audience:
Startups, small businesses: collecting feedbacks from their customers, improving their website.
Basic users: seeking an intuitive digital experience.

3. Initial Features: 
-Arrows, highlights: Clickable and dynamic pointers for navigation. 
-Popups and Tooltips: Onboarding popups, contextual tooltips, and trigger-based popups.
-Interactive Walkthroughs: Step-by-step tutorials with progress indicators and restart options.

Find where your ideal potential customers hang out, check some groups, subreddits, or anywhere where you think you potential customers are and start either reaching them 1 on 1 via cold emails, cold calls and DM's or either start posting content that will attract that kind of people that might show an interest.

2. Let them know about your software but don't force them to buy your stuff. Give them a free trial, because it will warm them up. They will turn into customers once they see the benefits of using your software.

3. Find a way to collect a feedback of your customers about your software and what could be improved and just listen to them -  it will make them stay with your SaaS for a longer period of time, which will results in more profits in the end.

I also study product management and would have crossover skills there from my strategy work, which involved a lot of managing stakeholders, getting feedback from multiple departments of an org, and building a product (in that case a content strategy) that would drive business goals. 

I really don’t want to work for a slow company. I want the pace. I want a little chaos. I want some wins. I have early days and late nights and would love to focus that energy a bit. 

I’m looking for advice. Im non-traditional and self taught, but I’ve worked with a YC backed team that taught me a lot. That wasn’t the right role for me long term because my skills were mostly on the frontend for that contract (I did not know Elixir). 

Advice I’m seeking: what should I do to find a good opportunity in a startup when it seems like most are looking for senior talent?

I don’t know if I’m over applying or what. I’ve seen people here say just reach out, tell them why you like the company and see if they’re open to chat. 

Any advice would be helpful.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d26f,1i30nw1,Considering asking a friend to work on an app with me and need advice,"I'm a few months away from launching an app.  I've spent the last year and 3 months writing it in my free time.

My friend has expressed interest on several occasions in wanting to code something with me outside of work, and I've thus far avoided telling him about the fact that I've been working on this.  I feel kinda bad about not telling him about my app, but at the same time, I don't really need any help at the moment.  But at some point, ideally, I will, and I think being like, ""hey man, I know you've been wanting to code something with me for a while, but I secretly launched this startup if you'd like to join now"" might be kind of a weird conversation.  Of all my friends, he's my first choice for who I'd like to work with, and I don't want him to feel like I haven't been completely straight with him.

My main reason for avoiding the topic has been because I haven't wanted to deal with figuring out how ownership would work.  Perhaps selfishly, I've wanted to preserve as much ownership as possible.  I've put a lot of time and effort into this.  I first had this app idea about 8 years ago, but a year and 3 months ago, I had a breakthrough that made it actually viable to create.  I don't need help covering the infrastructure costs or anything, at least initially.  The majority of the app is done at this point, and I'd still want to launch the mvp entirely on my own.  What I was thinking about bringing him in on would be the first feature to be added after launch.

However, I feel weird continuing to lie by omission to my friend.  I especially want to preserve a good relationship because he can probably get me a job at his company, which is in an industry that is very hard to break into.  If the app doesn't take off in such a way that I'd confidently quit my job to work on it full time, I'd like to move to his company.  So, I'm going to have to tell him about this sooner or later, it just remains to be seen whether I'll be asking for a job or offering one, haha.

So, I guess I could use some advice in terms of having the conversation with him about the app.  I already dislike entangling financial shit among friends, so I feel it's best to be clear and upfront about what percentage of ownership I'd be giving him.  I've googled around a bit, but I wasn't able to find a good answer for what a fair offer to him would look like for a scenario like this.  All I found was people saying that anything but a 50/50 split tends to cause issues down the line.  But 50%, particularly at this point, seems like too much.  Or am I just being greedy?

Also, any suggestions for how to bring it up in a way without being like, ""yeah, so, I've been working on this thing in secret..."" would be much appreciated.",startups,1737065008.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i30nw1/considering_asking_a_friend_to_work_on_an_app/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d272,1i2wnsn,ClickUp with its misleading calculator made my decision easier to go towards multiple but the best tools instead of one ultimate solution,"I’m at the point of deciding which tools to use for my new startup. With so many tools out there, I think pre-planning could save me from potential migration expenses or tech debt. But will it?

Some Reddit posts led me to ClickUp's website (which I have a history with), where I came across their misleading calculator on the front page. This pushed me even further away from ClickUp and the all-in-one solution. Let me know if I’m missing something, but here’s what I found:

I made a quick calculation for a team of 100 members. Here’s the breakdown:

* **Linear**: 30 members \* $8 = **$240 per month**
* **Slack**: 100 members \* $6.67 = **$667 per month**
* **Loom**: 10 members \* $10 = **$100 per month**
* **HubSpot**: 20 members \* $50 = **$1,000 per month**
* **Miro**: 70 members \* $8 = **$560 per month**

**Total**: $2,567 per month, which equals **$30,804 per year**, not **$115,200** as per ClickUp’s sales calculator.

The catch here is that not all 100 members will need Loom or HubSpot and the calculator takes into account htat all 100 will use those tools. Do all your members use all of the tools?

I selected those tools wiht 100 members as parameter in the calculator and here is what I received.

""ClickUp can save a 100 person company $115,200 per year compared to the non-enterprise price of your apps.""

I’ve finally decided to go with separate tools—but the best ones. The only requirement is to have good migration features, so I can stay flexible if I ever need to switch. This way, we’re also supporting other startups like ours, helping them explore new paths toward better tools, rather than relying on one “ultimate” tool and being stuck without the ability to adapt or migrate.

How did you handle this task in the begining of your startup?",startups,1737054646.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i2wnsn/clickup_with_its_misleading_calculator_made_my/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d273,1i2w2dg,From Agency Model to Venture Backed Startup - Our Learnings,"in 2024 I decided to quit my 9-5 job (AI deeptech startup) and launch my own business with my brother (he is actually the brain behind it, PhD in ML/AI and Stanford) and do AI Consulting and R&amp;D for businesses. It started with some side gigs during the stay of my brother in Silicon Valley to afford the expensive stay there. Soon we realized that the customers want more, they want AI apps to be developed for them. 

So we went all in in 2024 and founded our own agency. We promoted our gigs (primary fiverr) and soon got  a lot of requests from single entrepreneurs trying to build an mvp for their (not yet funded) startup to SMBs to large corporations (&gt;1bn € revenue, yes even large corporations go to fiverr to hire freelancers). 

Since we were absolute beginners in this area, we couldn't convert some of the prospects and they started ghosting us. Some of them validated their AI ideas (we litterally gave them free consulting) and went for cheaper freelancer shopping (You know where) and other won't sign a contract even after finalizing the requirements.

This brought us to an idea of getting another Co-Founder (since we couldn't afford hiring an employee for sales) as a chief revenue officer, to get us more sales. We had many interviews with potential co-founders, we used YC Co-Founder matching and had pretty good candidates (ex-Amazon, ex-Meta, Ex-Microsoft). We went with one of them and even created sophisticated contracts and agreements with a lawyer which cost us about 10k€. 

In the meantime, while the contracts were being drafted, our new co-founder had to come up with a sales strategy and that's where it's getting bizarre, she started ghosting us and until this day, we don't know why. But, this brought us to the conclusion to overthink our approach to go for a sales co-founder. We started educating ourselves about sales techniques and how to convert prospects into customers. In this process we learned, that **founder sales**  is the only way to become successful short to medium term. 

So, we educated ourselves and created a script (step by step) how to do sales. With this script we were able to separate the wheat from the chaff and It only took us 1 hour (two sessions, 15 minutes + 45 minutes) to get to the point where the client decided whether they wanted to continue or not. This saved us a lot of time. 

During the development process and in discussions with customers, we discovered a problem that almost all of our customers and potential customers had and this is the part where every experience, every job, and every interaction me and my brother had, led us to exactly this new venture. We found a new startup, solving the problem and currently in pre-seed stage.

We feel like this is the destiny which brought us to this point. 

If you want to know more or discuss further, I am happy to answer any questions or learnings I had.

here are the facts:

•⁠  ⁠he raised money for a different idea in 2020/2021 and then at some point ran out of money and pivoted to the current idea. he launched it a year ago. i think he raised a couple of million but can't remember for certain as we only had one convo on it.
 
•⁠  ⁠⁠the pivot is now doing fairly well. its an app on the app store. 

•⁠  ⁠⁠he has like $150k in ARR and people are using the app, but its buggy and he wants to really grow it

•⁠  ⁠⁠his proposition is: 60/40 split if just me and him, but he’s also open to a second technical person to move it along quicker (unsure of the split here if this happens). 

•⁠  ⁠⁠he doesn’t want any extra VC money anymore and would rather this be a “lifestyle” business at like a 5-10MM ARR. (i really like this) 

•⁠  ⁠⁠he mentions he would highly prefer me not to have any side contracts and doesn’t want us to take any salaries while we grow it for the next 6mo-1year

this sounds like a pretty solid opportunity to get in on an app that’s already has some level of PMF, but at the same time i’m immediately nervous about getting screwed. for one, i have a 3mo contract that just landed on my plate which is likely going to be a solid amount of money. i do understand why someone would want me to not contract and have all of my attention on this app but at the same time i proposed that i contract while he and i do a trial period for a month or two and he thinks that if we go down that route, then we should revisit the equity because im taking less risk. but my argument to that is — i actually likely would take more risk than him at that point because if we don’t work out then i have literally nothing (including lost income from the lack of side cash) and he still has 100% of a business with revenue. am i being unreasonable?

the other thing is, even if the trial works well, we're not like starting a company from scratch together where we'd both have to vest ownership over 4 years. it's fully his company at this point, and it would be dead simple for him to just fire me at less than a year mark and i'd be left with zero after putting in a lot of effort.",startups,1737046355.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i2tde0/need_advice_on_this_deal_of_joining_an_existing/

Sadly, most of the world's managers fail to recognize this fact - the fact that there are few management tools around the world that can produce repeatable management processes is evidence of how few people are aware of the nature of management.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs didn't realize this until after his company went public, and he regretted getting started so late. ""Almost everything in the world can be seen as a repeatable process"" is enough to prove that Jobs, at least at that time, really stepped on the threshold of the nature of management.

Do you agree with this view and do you think the management tools on the market today meet the management needs of entrepreneurs?

It needs to be emphasized that the handling of things to do again is only a low-level management, and can never bring exponential growth in the efficiency of the company.

For those not in the know:

&gt;**Factoring in finance** is like selling your unpaid invoices to a third party (called a factor) to get cash immediately, instead of waiting for your customers to pay you. It’s a way for businesses to improve their cash flow, especially if they have slow-paying clients.

Let's say for the sake of argument that your invoices are in the $2-20k range. Are there services any of you have used for this?

Six months ago, I graduated from a top MBA program with high hopes of landing a great job, achieving financial stability, and growing both personally and professionally. After a year without a paycheck, I joined a solar panel installation startup serving residential, commercial, and industrial clients.

Initially, the founders sold me on the dream: a general manager role with responsibilities in operations, supplier management, permits, and a minor focus on sales. They assured me I’d have support, guaranteed pay, and commissions. The first two months were great—I closed several deals, felt valued, and saw potential.

But then things started unraveling:

1. **Unpaid Salaries**: Payments have been inconsistent. October’s salary was delayed for two months, and I’m still missing one month’s pay (and now December’s too). I’ve been told I’ll be paid *when* a valuable client makes their payment, but there’s no timeline for this.
2. **Leadership Issues**: The founders often take “business trips” to places like LA and Cancun, yet leave me struggling to make ends meet. They recently bought a luxury car, which feels tone-deaf given the company’s financial struggles.
3. **Broken Promises**: Operational tasks like permits were initially ignored. I had to step in and solve these issues myself, despite being told they’d be handled by management.
4. **Growing Workload**: I’m now supposedly “promoted” to Operations Manager, taking on almost all aspects of the business—administering sellers, installations, suppliers, and more—while still being expected to sell.
5. **No Work-Life Balance**: My responsibilities have grown so much that I’m struggling to have any life outside of work. My evenings, weekends, and personal goals (like taking language courses and spending time with my fiancée) have taken a backseat.

I understand that financial struggles are common in startups, as they don’t have the financial backbone of larger corporations. I went into this with my eyes open, knowing there would be challenges. But now I’m questioning if this level of financial instability and lack of organization is *normal* as part of the business cycle—or if it’s a sign of deeper, structural issues.

To the entrepreneurs and startup veterans out there: is this par for the course, or is it a red flag that I should be cutting my losses? Would love to hear your experiences and advice.

What should I do? Should I stick it out and hope things improve, or is it time to leave?",startups,1736981918.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i2acyj/should_i_stay_or_go_advice_needed_for_my_startup/

The process feels like a juggling act—balancing cost, quality, and speed while trying to grow the business.

I’ve tried a few approaches: doing it myself (which takes forever), using platforms like Upwork and Fiverr (inconsistent results, and it’s hard to find someone who fits long-term), and experimenting with ATS tools like LinkedIn or Workable (too expensive or not flexible enough for small teams).

Each option seems to come with trade-offs, and honestly, the time spent on hiring could be better used elsewhere. I’ve been thinking about what an ideal hiring system would look like—something affordable, quick, and reliable that doesn’t just surface resumes but helps identify hidden talent and ensure they’re a good fit.

Long-story-short, I have a startup that operates in the marketing business (B2B focused). Currently I have 10 live contracts and on average each contract needs funding of about $1M with a payable 10% comission towards me. The growth has been purely organic, haven’t spent a single dime on advertising. What I’m targeting is indeed (and this is without the regular day-dreaming of founders) a huge market and the idea, after a lot of research, has not been exploited in the shape and size I want to build it to.
In terms of revenue, I only have a $10k transaction so far and progress is slow because the platform is not yet built and all the outreach I have to do manually through cold outreach. However, with the platform/website + app built, I anticipate for the pace to increase significantly.
Now, I plan on doing a capital raising round soon and currently working on the pitch deck, but on the “Ask” slide, I have absolutely no clue what to write or how to go about to have a realistic valuation of the company. I don’t want to aim too high because then investors will say that I’m daydreaming, but I don’t want to put too low of a valuation and risk of diluting myself more than I have to.

Just wanted to share my experience since I know many of you are dealing with auth costs. 

Last December, my AWS bill hit me hard - $360 just for Cognito. We have around 110k MAU, and while I love AWS for many things, this felt like a punch in the gut.


Decided to give Supabase a shot this month, and holy cow, the difference is night and day:

Cognito vs Supabase quick breakdown:

- Pricing: Cognito charged me $350, Supabase auth is FREE (up to 100k MAU, we will spend ~40$ with the same amount of active users)
- Setup time: Cognito took 2 days to set up properly, Supabase took us 3 hours (migration will take longer)
- Documentation: Cognito docs made me want to cry, Supabase docs are actually human-readable
- UI components: Had to build everything custom with Cognito, Supabase has pre-built components that don't look like they're from 1995

The migration took us a whole weekend (we have 1.1M registered users and we needed to be extra careful with user data). 

We learned the hard way. With the new SaaS that we are launching next week (SEO on autopilot), will use supabase from the start 😁

Anyone else make the switch? Or are you still stuck with Cognito? Curious to hear your auth stories and if you've found other alternatives.",startups,1736975147.0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i27sb8/paid_360_for_aws_cognito_in_december_just/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d28e,1i27o5b,Any advice for someone wanting to build MVPs?,"So, I taught myself to program starting in 2021. It’s been a wild ride. I’ve learned a lot. Caught myself slipping in meta frameworks, went back to building separate front and backends, taught myself containerization to add some devops to the mix, and have generally become really good at taking an idea and turning it to a full product. 

I’m currently at the end of helping a stealth startup get to MVP. I did this for the learning experience and to prove to myself that I could take it all the way. 

But I can’t do that any longer. I want to get paid for this. Getting paid helps me do it better and faster because then I’m not worried about $$. 

The job market is tough and I get calls with people who love my energy and can tell I know my stuff, but who time and time again tell me that the next person up will probably not be as excited by the fact that I have less than 5 years in software and/or that I don’t come from a traditional CS background. 

So I’m looking for advice. I’m good at what I do. I predominantly build front ends in React (big surprise) and stick with TS across the stack (and occasionally Python). 

I guess the issue is that I don’t know how to find clients. Not paying ones anyway. I know how to find the ones who want me to help for equity. I just step out into the cool breeze for that. 

But I’m really looking for advice. I love startups. I love the push. I love the energy! So I would love to help some founders go from idea to MVP really quickly.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d28f,1i271xo,"I built an app from scratch as a self-taught coder, and here's what I learned","Today I launched my app after developing for 1.5 years. I know I'm not the most skilled person because it took me a long time to make the social media app but this really means a lot to me. 

A year and a half ago, my roommate came to me with a simple dilemma: ""Which outfit should I wear for my first casual date?"" And we had this discussion for a solid 30 minute. Ultimately he chose the other option of what I chose.

And since that day I started to find small dilemmas people face like choosing the best tattoo design on the arm, deciding which jacket to buy, finding the perfect birthday gift for their mothers, or even picking the right chicken jerky for a puppy.

And then I just thought, wouldn't it be funny if I made an app where people can dump all their dilemmas and others can help them to solve it? I know this isn't a groundbreaking app and Reddit actually solves a lot of people's problems too but I just wanted to build an interactive, visually appealing dilemma solving app.

I didn’t know how to code at the time. But I really wanted to build this project. So I went around the engineering building in my college and asked people if they would be interested in the app.

  
All of them rejected me.

  
I mean, I get it. I was a freshman at the time and everyone was probably busy with their homework and getting a full time job or an internship. 

So, I taught myself how to code; 15 hours a day, making mistakes, breaking things, and rebuilding them. The thing is because I didn't have a mentor, I wasn't sure if I'm learning in the right way. But eventually, in early 2024, I built my first mvp. It wasn’t pretty. The UI was terrible, the backend was worse, but it worked. I learned more from that messy first version than any tutorial could have taught me.

  
And from that crappy MVP, I was actually able to start a team. People were starting to get interested with the idea. And with my team, we finally launched the app today :)



# And this is what I learned:

**1. It can be a lonely journey**  
When I started coding, I didn’t know where to begin. I watched Coursera courses, YouTube tutorials, and asked people for advice. But the truth is, the best way to learn how to code is by actually coding rather than just watching a video. During breaks, I’d spend 15 hours a day coding because it became fun. But when errors hit, it was frustrating.

There were moments when I felt stuck for days with no one to turn to for help. ChatGPT back then wasn’t as good as it is now, and no one I knew believed in the project. As exciting as this journey can be, it can also be lonely and incredibly stressful.

**2. Just ask and reach out**  
One time, I was stuck on a coding problem for over a week. I was so desperate that I cold-emailed a senior engineer at Microsoft. I didn’t know him, but I figured, why not try. To my surprise, he replied and actually helped me solve the problem.

It’s crazy to think that my peers rejected helping me, but a complete stranger, a Microsoft engineer, took the time to assist. 

So you never know what can happen unless you ask. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

**3. Work on it yourself first**  
Looking back, I’m glad no one agreed to build the app **for** me. Learning to code taught me the technical side of my business, which is so valuable even now that I have teammates. When I work with my team, I understand what they’re doing, how long things should take, and what to expect.

Beyond that, I now know almost everything about my business—coding, opening a business bank account, forming an LLC, marketing, and more. This makes me quite confident when talking about my company to anyone. It’s better to hire people when you know how to solve it rather than being completely in the dark.

**4. Enjoy the Journey**  
When I first started, I dreamed about selling this app for millions and becoming rich. Though I still kinda want to be rich, I'm not building my app to be rich. I’ve realized that this journey has connected me with amazing, like-minded people, some of whom have become my closest friends.

Seeing my app grow from a clunky MVP to a solid product is incredibly rewarding. Creating something out of nothing is a satisfaction I can’t describe. If I didn’t enjoy the process, I would have quit long ago.

So, if you’re thinking about starting something, don’t just focus on the outcome. Enjoy the process, expand the connections, and enjoy the small wins along the way :)

We have finally landed on a company vision that we love. We spent the last year chasing ""boring businesses"" that could make us money quickly before realizing we kind of hated it. Our current niche is notoriously difficult but if the last year has taught me anything it's that:

\- Chances of succeeding are low anyway, might as well work on what you want (granted there needs to be the possibility of making big money if you succeed)

\- Selling something that actually solves people's problems actually gets a very high response rate (aka cold calling is not just a numbers game)

\- There's always someone else wishing they were where you are (relax on stressing yourself over your own moving goalpost)

I checked the US trademark database as well as WIPO (is this reliable for searching international trademarks?) and it doesn't seem to be trademarked.

I searched for businesses with this name and a couple things came up in a Google search. My industry is very heavily regulated and so a lot of our information is public information. The first thing that comes up is an old filing from a company using the name I would like to use. Their registration has been listed as inactive for about 6 months. Their website is down too so it looks like they are no longer in business.

I don't see any regulatory actions in their records that some might accidentally associate with my business.

The second thing that comes up with a Google search is a company in South Africa. They don't have a website. It is just an address with a phone number. Either the address is inaccurate or it is a home based business because Google Street view shows an alleyway with what looks like residences.

Because our industry is so heavily regulated, we have to be registered federally and in every state where we do business.

I’m at a place where, while I appreciate the value my partner brings to the business and absolutely recognize that, it’s clear the commitment is not even and I can’t rely on my partner as a 50/50 partner anymore. 

I don’t want to be in a place where I grow this business to something really substantial over the next 10 years and then my partner decides to cash out with 50% of equity after sitting sideline for such a long time. Ideally what I’d like to do is instill some sort of new vesting structure beginning in 2025 where I earn additionally equity in the business each year based on my time committed. 

All we have in our current ownership agreement is something that says if either of us work less than 500 hours in a year, we must revisit our equity arrangements. 

My question is whether introducing some sort of new structure like this is appropriate, fair, and realistic? My partner is reasonable and I believe will understand my point of view, but I want to approach this conversation prepared with a realistic gameplan of how something like this would be executed. Is there a certain approach to this kind of vesting structure we should look into? 

Appreciate any and all advice. ",startups,1736953093.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i1z77g/new_vesting_structure_already_established_equity/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2a1,1i1udg0,Hey ! Check out our Project idea and help us out a little bit,"
We are a team of four 3rd-year college students skilled in web development (frontend and backend), databases, and integrating Machine Learning models. We have six months to build a project for our 6th and 7th semesters, and we want it to be something that really stands out on our resumes.

Here’s the idea we’ve come up with so far:

We want to create a web application that helps users plan their tasks based on their personal productivity patterns. The process starts with creating a user profile where we’ll ask questions like:

How many hours can you effectively work in a day?
How many days a week are you comfortable working?
What kind of tasks do you prefer doing at different times of the day (e.g., new and challenging tasks in the morning, repetitive tasks like debugging in the evening)?
Users can personalize this for each day of the week or even the entire month.

Whenever a user thinks of a task, they just need to add it to our app along with details like:

How long they think it will take to complete,
The task’s priority,
Its deadline,
And the type of task it is.
Using this information, our ML model will figure out the optimal way for users to structure their day. It will help them plan what to work on and when, ensuring they never miss deadlines. It’ll also highlight:

Tasks they haven’t completed yet,
Tasks they’re currently working on,
Tasks that are unrealistic given their workload (e.g., if they’ve added too many tasks with overlapping deadlines).
The model will suggest which tasks to prioritize, which ones might need more focus, and even warn them if they’re overloading themselves. This way, users don’t have to worry about planning every detail—it’s all handled by the system.

We’re also thinking of making it possible for organizations or teams to see task progress across members, so it’s useful for collaboration too.

We’d love to hear any feedback you have—whether it’s to improve this idea or suggest something entirely new. We really want this project to be amazing!",startups,1736936032.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i1udg0/hey_check_out_our_project_idea_and_help_us_out_a/

I’ve been working on a deep tech hardware startup 3 years that’s focused on a technology that has the ability to greatly improve health, the environment, and make communities more resilient against climate change. I’m a nontechnical solo Founder who has had a hard time finding someone else to fill the CTO role &amp; went through 4 different leads throughout the years. I finally found someone in the summer who is absolutely perfect for the role and niche experience needed. We’ve made monumental progress since bringing the CTO on board, but have a long ways to go before commercialization. I just got on payroll in the summer &amp; lived below the poverty line the first 2 years and barely about last year (luckily had no debt and good savings), and pay my CTO &amp; other contractors lower than market but as fair as possible with our resources. 

My CTO has been working for another company here and there to help make ends meet. Now the company needs my CTO to go full time. They’re able to compensate our CTO at a much fairer rate (above market even) and our CTO needs more stability. 

We’re currently fundraising and recently received our first check. If I throw in the towel now we can return that money &amp; Id have about $20k available to me as a parting payment. This is everything I’ve worked toward for 40-70 hrs/week the last few years. My community is rooting for us to succeed because of the potential positive impact, but we’re at least a year if not more from first sales. If I continue fundraising it’d have to be under the pretense I didn’t know my CTO was thinking of stepping away for another opportunity. Then we’d have the money to potentially find someone new or perhaps hire an external firm for help. But fundraising is already difficult especially since we’re so novel. The R&amp;D government grants we were applying to we won’t get without our technical person. With the runway we have we could keep going until ~April (when we are up for a contract for $ to do a paid pilot), &amp; I could try to find someone else to fill the role. Our CTO wants to stay involved but has been scatter brained since things picked up at the company and is making a lot of mistakes with tasks causing them to take much longer than necessary. We also agreed to hire an operations person to help manage at the end of last year and I am about to extend an offer to someone for that :( If we were an everyday startup in it for the money Id probably throw in the towel, but our social issue is so large I don’t know what to do.

Between all the how to, advice and success content, which is all good, there's been something missing for me and perhaps others as well.

\---

On paper, I was living the Silicon Valley dream – a heartwarming immigrant success story straight from the TechCrunch cookie cutter. A first generation immigrant educated at top US universities, a four time founder, my previous company had grown to doing billions in GMV, now going through YC for the second time, successfully closed a seed round off a TikTok account and Product Hunt launch, bought a house, started a family, and all the other boxes society tells you to check. If this were a LinkedIn post, you’d probably be hate-following me by now. And if I ever actually paused to appreciate anything, I might’ve been proud myself.

Instead, I could never let myself feel satisfied because deep down what I really sought was approval from an imaginary panel of ruthless judges who lived rent-free in my head and reality soon caught up with my expectations. The shine on the new startup quickly wore off and we were well into the trough of sorrow a year after launching. The previous company had started to fall off a cliff, and along with it went my hopes of financial security, let alone abundance. At home, two young kids needed a present father, my wife needed a partner, and somewhere between investor updates and bedtime stories, I was failing at being either the founder or family man I'd imagined myself to be. As I later learned, the immense pressure I felt from all sides was just the crucible necessary to catalyze what James Hollis calls the “middle passage”, though I clearly prefer the thrill ride of a midlife crisis instead.

Everything was starting to feel deeply wrong and out of control and, most frustratingly, the forty some years of carefully accumulated knowledge that I was sure made me sound smart at dinner parties was suddenly useless. Except one little morsel. A few years prior I’d read a book recommended by Justin Kan, the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, which planted a seed of an idea - that there is an entirely different way of being, as a leader, and in life in general. But, as anyone who’s ever bought a Peloton knows, there’s a big gap between knowing what you should do and doing it. I needed a bigger push, and this came serendipitously when a former batchmate, Nancy Hua, also wrote about the group behind the book and their in-person group coaching, which I soon joined.

By now, there was a faint, but growing, and utterly terrifying, understanding that the underlying software, the operating system of my personality, had actually been constructed without my input and here I was strutting around, pretending to be a person I imagined myself to be, rather than who I really was. The accountability and the support of the group intensified the debugging process, kicking off an excavation to “find myself” and realize the extent of the improbable, yet quite impressive, architecture of my own bullshit.

As my awareness expanded, so did my courage to face the questions I'd spent my whole life avoiding. Why did I start this company? What were the chips on my shoulder and where did they come from? Who are my role models and why? Whose approval am I seeking and why isn’t my own good enough? How do I react when I do or don’t get what I want and why?

I kept asking why like a broken record until I’d reach a place that made sense (a sense marked by an alignment of thoughts, emotions and body sensations). The answers to these questions created new choices and gradually loosened the hold of various patterns that I now recognized weren’t really serving me. It turned out that I was looking for control and approval in all the wrong places, and now I had the power to have both. In fact, I had it all along.

There are countless ways to embark on this particular hero's journey – books, therapy, coaching, near-death experiences (don’t recommend!), or simply mustering the courage to ask a friend what they really see when they look at you. But all paths lead to the same destination: expanding awareness and the sweet relief of finally meeting yourself. This expansion brings clarity and authenticity, as well as a sensitivity to being out of integrity with that authenticity.

I could go on, but here’s the point: you are the creator of your life. This single shift from seeing life happening to you into seeing that you create it, all of it, changes everything.

You might be thinking - cool, but the payoff from reading all this is an IPO and a Forbes cover, right? Honestly, I don’t know anything about that, but I sure hope they’ll do 80 under 80 cause I might be a while. What I can say is that all this has resulted in major transformations in both personal and professional life, and I’m very much looking forward to continuing the journey.

These days, when I catch myself performing for that imaginary panel of judges, I try to smile and wave. They still show up uninvited, but now they're more like old friends who overstay their welcome than the ruthless arbiters of my worth. And sometimes, in between investor updates and bedtime stories, I catch glimpses of something that feels suspiciously like peace.",startups,1736893937.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i1igpj/a_founders_midlife_crisis/

Examples: I pay to stream music but never find the music I like, I pay for comfortable running shoes but my ankles always hurt, I pay for premium coffee beans but it tastes like regular coffee

2. Confirm a large group of people on the internet pay to achieve the same outcome and agree that the outcome isn't as expected

Example: reddit post with 500 likes “anyone else disappointed by their Spotify discover weekly playlist?”

Consider: searching keywords like “disappointed” “frustrated” “annoying” “boring” ""refund"" ""scam"" or direct competitor names

3. Estimate how valuable creating that behavior would be for the smallest group of people who need it most (MVP) AND the largest group of people (potential market)

Example: You post to social: “would you pay $3/month for the perfect playlist of new songs”

4. Start helping the smallest group of people create that behavior for the price you estimated

Example: create a custom GPT agent that uses a user input of their 3 favorite songs and suggests niche tracks

5. YES - PEOPLE PAY: move to step 10

6. NO - PEOPLE DON’T PAY: iterate on price and messaging until people pay

7. NO ONE EVER PAYS: go back to step 1

9. As you help people create the intended outcome (manually) take note of the top 2 or 3 reasons the outcome is unblocked

RULE: you must observe people IRL using your product

10. Design product feature(s) that directly address the top reasons in step 9 (product beta)

RULE: must be designed in a UX/UI your user base is familiar with (DON'T BE CUTE - YOU'RE NOT STEVE JOBS!)

11. Add a “feedback loop” (or multiple) to test if these product feature(s) together create many positive outcomes

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2b4,1i1b2pb,Startup Advisors... When to listen and when to dig your heels in,"This is gonna be part rant and part questions.

I am struggling to figure out how best to work with some of my startup advisors. I'm a 50+ year old founder and I've been bootstrap building my AI finance and scenario planning platform for a number of years. Started raising our pre-seed a few months ago and now have some capital - and some of that capital has come with advisors. Still running super lean and building something that is novel; the playbook isn't super obvious as it doesn't fit cleanly into ""the rules"". More of a category creation challenge.

How do other founders successfully work with advisors when you don't necessarily agree with them?

I'm trying to be coachable and open to feedback.

But I am also learning that people only know what they have experience with. And there advice tends to gravitate, understandably, to their comfort zone. For example, one of my advisor and investors has been wildly successful building tech inside of an existing software ecosystem. So, of course, a lot of the advices is pattern repeating. But that also means that they've been out of the startup game for almost two decades and are making suggestions that feel right to them but aren't in sync with the startup 101 game.

I'm getting advice to pivot from an existing go-to-market when my spider senses tell me that we simply haven't tried hard enough/had enough conversations in the current one.

Everyone talks about focus - and I get it - but I also think there is real danger in just scratching the surface on a vertical or ICP or market. Having only a few conversations and then reacting/pivoting just because you hear something you don't like is also super dangerous.

Option 1: Hard Tech with Experienced Founder

	•	Hardware-driven, tackling an urgent global problem.
	•	Founder has multiple successful exits and strong fundraising experience.
	•	Already has pre-seed funding (1-3M USD).
	•	I’d have 5% equity (potentially growing to 10%).
	•	Faster sales cycle but scaling hardware adds complexity.

Option 2: Software Startup (MIT Spinout)

	•	Software-focused, spun out of MIT, with early interest from U.S. government agencies.
	•	Likely reliant on grants and prizes initially, as it’s not VC-backable.
	•	Could be profitable from the first client.
	•	I’d own 50% equity.
	•	Longer sales cycles but highly scalable.

Both are in the climate/impact space, which I’m passionate about. Would you choose the lower equity/faster path or the higher equity/slower growth route?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2be,1i12hfq,I left this Gurgaon startup after sexual misconduct and bad behaviour,"`TLDR: A former employee shares their experience of working in a startup, highlighting the stressful and toxic work culture. Instances of forced overtime, lack of proper breaks, scrutiny over taking leaves, and other forms of mental and emotional abuse are discussed. The piece also mentions specific incidents of inappropriate behavior by the management, including forced social media promotion and sexual misconduct. The author emphasizes the necessity of better management practices and employee care in startups.`

Since many people are coming out and sharing their stories about their work place, this is a small glimpse into one of the places I worked and it’s employees. I would not encourage sharing your personal feelings with your colleagues but this turned out to be the most fruitful decision I made during my tenure at this startup and you would soon know why.

There was this small startup that was building a **mental health application**. Wonderful idea, great thought. But this is a tale that is told to make people aware that what is happening with you is not normal and can also amount to mental abuse when you work in a startup that is so dangerously adamant on building things on a whim. Sometimes when people focus on just securing fundings, they forget real lives are at stake.

The startup began late in the year. People joined in and had so much work to do that people forgot about their own lives. People were sprinting hard to release an application in the January. We stayed in the offices for nights and back to back. Of course not with our will. But this is just the beginning of what happens when things go unpunished. I will try and list out instances where mental abuses happened. This is so that people are aware what is wrong and what is right.

# Time Management: A frightful clock

Often employees were forced to stay in office for long hours, often exceeding 24 hours to deliver whatever work was assigned to them. They took smoke breaks, tea breaks for relaxation. And who didn’t smoke were just strolling outside so that they could relax too from all the work.

Anyone who went out for a break, of course was looked down upon. The gaze from the management team said it all. One day they asked me to stop the team members from going out and have a break. Everyone takes a break. A long break combined, or multiple shorter breaks, if nothing is mentioned in the guidelines. I stood my ground and told I can’t stop my team from going out since that’s their right. They need to go out to relax and look away from the screen for a bit. I think that’s completely okay. But on that day, I realised how deep this thing goes.

If we came late, we were made fun of. Of course we informed prior. 11 AM was the reporting time. If anyone came late, that small group of people made their job to either question that person or make fun of the person or just taunt that person left and right.

One day, I came to office at 5:30 PM. That is 6.5 hours late to the office. Then why come, right? But the thing was, I gave an all nighter at the office the day before and left the office at 9 AM. So slept through till 4:30 PM.

*I received a phone call from the CTO asking where was I*.  
*I told him I was sleeping and the alarm couldn’t wake me up.*  
*He asked if I am coming to office or not. That means why are you not here in the office already.*  
*I told him I have just woken up, let me just fresh up and come to office.*

That day when I arrived, I was given a stern look and a hand gesture pointing to his wrist watch.I was carrying a tea glass and my bags with me. I saw that and suddenly my hands started shaking. My blood boiled that instant and I told him “***please also remind us to leave office at 8:30PM, Do this action at that time too***”. Since then, I have been doing that action to all the junior employees asking them to leave after 8:30 PM. Of course they didn’t. How could they? How dare them?

# Leaves and their aftershock

Employees who got sick, or were out on leaves or had some vacation planned for themselves were frowned upon and they were questioned in detail as to why they need to go and how this might be resulting in upsetting the management team. So people often avoided asking for leaves and the introverts or the shy people normally resulted in taking unplanned leaves or making excuses for leaves.

People who requested a leave on a Saturday, or a Monday, would normally be questioned in one of the cabins or in front of the whole team. And when they returned to the office, they were taunted. And their next leave had to be far in the future. It’s not like they didn’t give leaves if the person just sent a message over Whatsapp detailing why they needed a leave. It is the pressure they put their employees for asking for leaves.

I remember fainting in the office after I was working two nights straight. Not in the office. I was at home working in the night at my home because I was asked to. But I was in the office when that happened and I was immediately taken to the hospital and taken care of by the company. I asked for resignation and I walked out with a sabbatical for 1 month. I was grateful for the sabbatical. When I returned, I had less work load but never the less told “you were on a vacation for 1 month. So you must have enjoyed”.

I implore founders and leaders to think harder at what all they do because it affects their employees. And if you ask them and they don’t tell you. It is because you have been known for making fun of your own employees and ridiculing them. You know I am talking to you. You call yourself our friend but use your own employees and their innocence to get your work done after hours. Plan better. Do better.

# Forceful media presence

Imagine you work in a startup and you are asked to post about the company. Not a big deal right? I thought so too. The Content team delivers content to the Whatsapp group and the employees are forced to push that message out on LinkedIn from their personal profiles. If somehow, some people either forgot or just didn’t want to post, the founder asked the HR team to round up all the employees who haven’t posted and provide their name on the group and were asked to fire and send notice to all these employees, since “We are building a startup” and who ever is not aligned with the goal should step out. I mean I understand this is your own company so you might be attached. But you have to give your employees that care and understanding so that they want to post on their own and not force them into resignation.

# Sexual encounters and forceful firings

There was a party at a Founder’s place and people got together and were drinking and smoking. Very normal. There was this one girl who shall remain nameless for this article. This girl was an employee and also came to the party. She was visibly drunk after a while and she started taking support of the founder Y since she was just barely an adult. People in the party were anxious as to what was happening and a fight broke out between founder X and an employee. After the fight the party got over and every one was asked to leave. The founder Y, at whose place the party was hosted, came a little late to the scene.

What we got to know was horrific. Because this female employee was not feeling well, she went to the washroom and the founder Y went in too and locked after himself. With the female employee in there too. What happened, in there, was he actually helping out or doing something terribly wrong with that girl is still unknown. But he came out of the washroom after another employee started knocking on the door to bring the fight to the founder Y’s attention.

That female employee left the organisation after a month. The employee who got into the fight was also fired. The founder Y remains in the company, with people aware of this act and doing nothing about this. The founder Y often talks indecent language, talks about which female employee he likes the most.

# My exit from the company

The reason for my exit from this start up could be all the reasons combined but another thing happened. Another thing happened that I can’t really piece together. Let’s start with detailing out how this all happened.

Posh guidelines:

&gt;As per the provisions of the POSH Act, every workplace employing 10 (Ten) or more employees is required to constitute an Internal Committee (“Internal Committee”) to handle complaints related to Sexual Harassment and facilitate inquiry into the complaint. In situations where a workplace has multiple administrative units across various locations, it is necessary to establish an Internal Committee in each administrative unit. However, if a workplace has less than 10 (Ten) employees, all complaints of Sexual Harassment will be handled by the local committee established by district officers under the POSH Act.

So I believe, this is necessary by law. And for the time I spent in the company, I don’t believe any such training happened. This was the beginning. I get that people can be insensitive and that there are many kinds of people out there who might or might not agree with you. So POSH Training was necessary to teach what to say and what not to say and who to complain to if something went wrong. Since it never happened, there was no group formed for registering complaints. The HRs probably cannot do anything since they are just employees.

I am out of the closet to my family and friends. To people who I care for. When I joined this company, I made sure to check out the environment first to test the waters. Immediately on day 1, I knew I had to hide here. These are just college graduates, all men. And people higher up were adults who made fun of anyone they wanted. Either on their clothes, or on their looks. And mind you, these happen often.

I remember a party where the whole team was invited and I went too. We were talking and having fun when suddenly the founder Z makes a slight joke of femininity towards me. Everyone laughed. I didn’t.

In another instance, I remember there was a meeting outside the office premises where people were talking about how these people just don’t want to interact with the LGBTQ+ community. That, it just disgusts them. Mind you, so many people were there. My boss was there who I had already told about me earlier when I fainted and asked to resign. He just stood there and laughed at first. Then he saw my expressions changed and told everyone in the group to not talk about this. But I guess, it was too late.

I think this was the last nail in the coffin. I might have not told them about me, but I think I decided for myself that this should be enough. For me to take a stand and just quit from here. And I am glad I did.

There are so many more instances that happened in there. And much more. Employees are often criticised for either relaxing and eating out. Employees are also taunted for mistakes and sometimes made fun of. Often asked to stay longer and be part of the team. I don’t know how female employees feel out there. That’s their story to tell.

For people struggling in their jobs, this is not the end. Life is too big. This is definitely not the end. Yes, you will have to work hard for a while to get out of there and to find a new job, but that new found emotional and mental strength for yourself is much better.",startups,1736847492.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i12hfq/i_left_this_gurgaon_startup_after_sexual/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2c4,1i0vw49,Are Recommendation Letters a Legal Risk?,"**—TL;DR—**

I was the CMO of a tech startup but had a major falling out with my business partners because one of them was wildly irresponsible and dishonest. I was forced out (it was their business legally), but now a former intern is asking for a recommendation letter. I want to help this standout individual without damaging my reputation or inadvertently driving business to my ex-partners. How would you handle this?

**—FULL POST—**

Here’s the situation: I served as the CMO of a tech startup for about a year and a half. During that time, I had the privilege of working with some amazing interns. They were hardworking, eager to learn, and genuinely great to collaborate with. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about one of my business partners. Their irresponsibility and dishonesty were so severe that I felt compelled to call them out, leading to a messy fallout. I was ultimately forced out of the company (it was legally theirs), even though I was carrying most of the workload. Needless to say, it wasn’t a clean exit.

Now, one of my former interns, a project manager who truly stood out for their intelligence, empathy, and work ethic, has reached out asking for a recommendation letter. I genuinely want to help them because they deserve it, but I’m struggling with how to navigate this situation.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

- I’ve never written a recommendation for someone who worked with me after I left the company.

- I really don’t want to direct this intern to my former business partners. I don’t trust them and have no interest in driving business their way.

- I’m not sure how to handle potential questions like, “Why did you leave the company?” I want to be honest without jeopardizing my reputation, making things awkward for the intern, or stirring up drama with my former partners.

I’m trying to balance helping the intern (who was absolutely stellar) with protecting my own reputation and staying professional. Honestly, I’m also wondering if my emotions around the fallout with my partners are clouding my judgment here.

A little background about me:
currently finishing up my senior year in college and have no experience in startups. About four months ago I came up with an idea and it has surprisingly been really good and gotten great feedback. I am not technical but have good business skills. I’ve done my own learning about startups and have honestly learned a lot but still do not have experience.

What I am looking for:
Any founders current or past, and investors and such that can help me out, give some advice, and maybe look at my pitch deck and financials, etc., give me some validation on my product, maybe even join the startup if they really like it. And a mentor if someone wanted to guide a 22 year old through the startup world.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2c7,1i0spbw,Basic tips to help founders avoid overspending on MVP development,"Building an MVP or scaling your software project can get expensive fast if you’re not careful. Overpaying is surprisingly common, especially for entrepreneurs who are new to software development or under pressure to launch quickly. These tips might seem basic, a.k.a things “everyone knows”, but I’ve seen founders overlook them time and time again. I put together a short list with five steps to help avoid overpaying while still getting a quality product. Hope this helps some of you!

1. Clearly Define Your Requirements  
  
Founders approach developers with a vague idea of what they want. Without a clear roadmap, developers may overestimate time, build unnecessary features, or misinterpret your vision. *Advice:*

* Prioritize features. Stick to the ""minimum"" in MVP. Use frameworks like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) to help define what's essential.
* Create wireframes or mockups. Tools like Figma can help you visually communicate your ideas, reducing misunderstandings.

2. Research and Compare Rates  
  
Don't assume higher cost equals higher quality. While cheap developers can be risky, paying premium prices doesn't always guarantee a better outcome. *Advice:*

* Compare rates across freelancers, agencies, and offshore teams. Use platforms like Upwork, Toptal, or Clutch for benchmarks.
* Ask for portfolio samples and speak to previous clients. Prioritize developers with experience in your industry or technology stack.

3. Avoid Scope Creep  
  
Adding ""just one more feature"" mid-project can spiral costs and timelines out of control. *Advice:*

* Lock in a scope of work (SOW) before starting. Any changes should go through a formal review process with cost and timeline impacts clearly outlined.
* Use project management tools like Trello or Asana to track progress and ensure the team or developer stays on track.

4. Understand Payment Models  
  
Paying upfront or using the wrong payment model for your project can lead to overcharges or worse. *Advice:*

* Hourly: Use for projects where the scope isn’t fully defined. It offers flexibility but needs close monitoring. In short, you pay for the time spent on the project.
* Fixed Price: Use when the scope is clear and unlikely to change. Get a detailed contract to prevent hidden fees.
* Negotiate milestone-based payments to tie deliverables directly to payments. This way you only pay for work that’s completed and meets your requirements.

5. Monitor and Communicate Regularly  
  
Trusting developers to work unsupervised for weeks without updates can lead to not so fun outcomes. *Advice:*

* Schedule regular check-ins (weekly or bi-weekly) to review progress and address issues early.
* Request progress demos to confirm the product matches your vision.
* Use version control tools like GitHub to monitor development.

Final thoughts:   
  
Small investments in oversight and planning can save you from expensive mistakes down the line. If you aren't technical, it's hard to tell what's under the hood. You should have an independent developer review the code at different stages to ensure they know what they’re doing and to help prevent costly rewrites later.",startups,1736812963.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i0spbw/basic_tips_to_help_founders_avoid_overspending_on/

It helps you capture, compile, and share your daily moments in a 50-second vlog with friends and loved ones.

We are constantly updating the app and now we have a fairly stable version that works very well on most devices.

1. We managed to get some good views on TikTok from one video (200k+) that helped us get the first 2000 users but we lost most of them because when this happened during the summer the MVP was bad. **We did multiple times similar content but it did not work. How do we do this again?**
2. **How do you find the social media strategy that works best for you and the stage of your MVP?** Do people want to know that you are building a startup?

I have a start up craft distillery based in NZ, it has developed from its trial phase to a small business. I have had the dream of starting a craft distillery for around a decade, inspiring me to build equipment,  put myself through study, and gain experience in the industry. I met owners of a vineyard who became excited about the prospects of using their wine to produce brandy. We agreed to move my distillery into their workshop on a friendly handshake agreement, whereas there were no expectations yet everything to be gained from trialing how well we worked together and testing the product. 

We have a strong friendship, a great working relationship, and the understanding that this is a passion project for me. The vineyard recently purchased a new small workshop for the distillery, and has filed the paperwork to get us legal. Currently, the vineyard owns the work space, and has the capacity to sell the brandy under their own name.

It is time to structure the company. I intend to produce craft gin and whisky, as well as the colab brandy. The distillery will be its own limited company owning the distilling equipment, IP, and my labor. The vineyard owns the small workshop, and has funded us through the legal red tape. I estimate they have contributed $20,000nzd to the project, I value my equipment at $10,000 and IP is an unknown at this point. 

Do we:

Do they own the business outright and I buy my way in with sweat equity?

Some other arrangement I am unaware of? I'd love to hear other ideas or thoughts, this is my first partnership and I would like to create a solid foundation from which we can move forward in confidence and both get what we deserve as the company grows.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2cb,1i0pe97,Should Startup Messaging Focus on Mission or Product?  ,"Hi Redditors,  

I’m currently working on a startup and facing a dilemma about how to position our messaging. Our product has a ‘clear mission’ tied to making a positive impact, but it’s also designed to solve a very real problem with a smarter, more efficient solution.  

The challenge is finding the right balance:  

1. Mission-Driven Messaging: Highlighting the positive social impact of the product and how it aligns with values like fairness, inclusivity, or sustainability. This resonates emotionally but might make the product feel niche or too focused on a cause.  

2. Product-Driven Messaging: Emphasizing the product's value proposition, like efficiency, innovation, or ROI, to appeal to a broader audience. However, this risks losing the emotional connection and unique selling point tied to the mission.  

I’m wondering:  
- Have you dealt with this dilemma before, and how did you approach it?  
- Should startups lean more into mission to build a strong identity or focus on product to demonstrate scalability and viability?  
- How do you strike a balance between purpose and profitability in your messaging?  

I’d love to hear your experiences, advice, or insights—thanks in advance for your thoughts!

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2cc,1i0o4ms,"In 7 days I built an MVP and got an acquisition offer, my thoughts","End of November last year I had an idea of a product I wanted to build.  
  
Despite indicators of the space being crowded and it being a challenging product to build, I went for it. 

I built it over the course of 7 days, and launched an MVP. Two weeks later a competitor in the same space reached out wanting to acquire it. Now this doesn't mean success by all means, but I thought I'd share some thoughts to my fellow builders out there who might be stuck in building or stuck at the idea stage.

Here are some points that summarizes why and how:  
  
1) I had a problem I wanted to be solved.  
2) There are other solutions out there, but they are not doing it well enough.  
3) If I build it fast enough, failure means nothing.  
4) It's all about learning, learning something means success.

I know these are simple (and perhaps naïve) points, but they are  powerful. As a builder I constantly find myself looking at competitors and other solutions thinking ""oh it already exists"" or ""that must be tricky to build"" and get de-motivated from it.

However, my approach for this particular launch, I took the approach outlined above.  
\-&gt; Optimize for speed and learning, nothing else matters -&gt; zero expectations.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2d5,1i0d0z1,Advice on resource allotment at early stage ,"I recently took over the tech side of the house at an early stage, pre-rev startup. The founder had an overseas company developing the app that (in my opinion) was exploiting their lack of tech knowledge to get as much money out of them as possible. We broke things off with them and are starting to peel back the layers of what they handed off and it's a mess.

Now, what they built runs well enough that we were able to launch the pilot this last week at least. 

While the pilot is running we have some time to get things in order, however, **there are \~2 critical features we need to get developed and deployed asap**. My experience is entirely in front end, so there is risk of not having someone to monitor/maintain backend (which went down one time pre-release but we were able to get the old company to deploy a fix).   
  
As I see it there are a few decisions that need to be made at this moment using limited resources:  
**- Hire someone part time to manage backend**   
Pros: They have time to get familiar with the environment, needs before anything goes wrong as we increase users.  
Cons: Backend is expensive, takes significant resources from elsewhere. 

**- Hire additional frontend help for feature dev &amp; bug fixes at this critical UX time**  
Pros: Faster deployment time for these features, better user experience to mitigate dropoff during the pilot. Frees me up to focus on streamlining the front end and making it faster/easier to develop new features and fixes down the road.   
Cons: If backend were to have any issues we are scrambling. Developing new features right now will probably make unravelling their mess even more complicated (tech debt).

**- Do neither**, use our financial resource for marketing/recruitment, worry about backend/front end help after fundraising. 

If you could only choose one, what would you prioritize?

Should note that because of how messy and fragile the front end is, a simple bug fix often turns into an 80+ hour endeavor just finding the page/component it originates from. ",startups,1736771956.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i0d0z1/advice_on_resource_allotment_at_early_stage/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2d9,1i0b1bx,The Hardest Lesson I Learned After Burning Out in Sales,"
I'll never forget the day I almost quit sales altogether.
I was sitting in my home office at 11 PM, staring at my screen, surrounded by endless Automation tech. 
For months, I'd been working 12-hour days, sending hundreds of cold emails, obsessing over metrics, and trying every ""revolutionary"" sales tool that promised to 10x my results. 
My tech stack looked like a who's who of sales automation.
I was doing everything the ""experts"" preached. 
But my results? Painfully average. 
Each automated sequence, each perfectly crafted template, each ""personalization at scale"" trick... they all started blending together into a soul-crushing routine.

Then something happened that changed everything.

Late one night, exhausted and frustrated, I accidentally sent an unfinished email to a prospect. 
No pitch. No fancy formatting. Just a raw, honest message about how I'd been researching their company, understood their challenge, and thought I could help.
I panicked. This wasn't supposed to go out yet. It wasn't ""optimized.""

But here's the crazy part: They responded within 10 minutes. At 11 PM.

""Finally,"" they wrote, ""someone who actually gets it. Let's talk tomorrow.""

That mistake taught me what every sales ""guru"" gets wrong: It's not about selling better. It's about connecting better.

So I did something terrifying. I dropped most of my automation. 
Instead, I focused on:
-Actually researching every prospect before reaching out (not just mail-merging their company name)
-Writing emails that felt like they came from a human, not a bot
-Listening more than pitching
-Treating each conversation as unique, not just another ticket in the pipeline

The results? My response rates tripled. But more importantly, I started enjoying my work again. The conversations became real. The relationships became genuine.

Here's the truth: 
People don't want to be sold to. They want to be seen, understood, and valued. They can smell automation and fake personalization from a mile away.

Sometimes the hardest lessons are the simplest ones. And sometimes your biggest breakthrough comes from a mistake that shows you what was missing all along: genuine human connection.

After months of hesitation, I have decided to share my story, which grew from a random idea to replacing my 9-5 job.

# Numbers for the Curious

\- 🚀 Solo developer, fully bootstrapped

\- ⭐ 4.7 stars on Chrome Web Store

\- 👥 6000+ active users

\- 🌍 Paid customers from 46 countries

\- 📦 Shipping 2-3 updates monthly

# The Beginning

I was sitting with an old friend on a warm and bright June evening in 2022, having quit my job a few months earlier. We spent hours brainstorming product ideas, but nothing clicked. That night, I had this simple thought: what if I built an all-in-one browser extension for developers and designers? No market research, no fancy business plan – I just opened VS Code and started coding.

# The Building Journey

\- **Month 1-3**: Spent 14 hours/day coding, 7 days/week 😬

\- **Month 4**: Launched on ProductHunt (200+ upvotes, 45+ comments)

\- **Month 6**: Tweet went viral in Japan (96k views, 1000s of installs)

\- **Month 7**: Launched the paid version, got 8 sales in the first week 😺

\- **Month 8**: Built a proper website that increased sales by 4x

\- **Month 9-24**: Kept improving the extension based on user feedback

\- **Month 25**: Hit 6000+ users, got featured on Chrome Web Store 🎉

\- **Month 29**: Now have paid customers from 46 countries

# Key Lessons Learned

\- Create an easy-to-use painkiller product and design it well

\- Launch on ProductHunt, BetaList, and more to gain visibility

\- Keep it free as long as possible to gain enough users 😬

\- Get customer feedback and ship fixes and new features

\- Launch the paid version after gaining enough users

Drumrolls....

1. A Twitter-like fanfic app - turns out, building in isolation isn’t great and b2c isn't all that great either unless it solves a real need or problem
2. A peer to peer study app for CA students - good idea imo, but no talking to the 10+ users who actually signed up within the first week of launch (crying)
3. A social media app for CAs - too niche, not sticky enough (plus CAs refuse to talk to you if it's not about making more money or getting more clients. Not at all interested in shiny new things. Can't blame them, ofc)
4. An app for managing client communications for CAs - great problem, wrong execution. Started building WITHOUT talking to CAs. Call me dumb bcz I really was hehe)

Failure’s a tough teacher. While I am glad for the bad experiences, I am really not gonna say I'd welcome anything of that sort again.

The one thing I learned from my failure is that I gave up too soon or feared too much. Confidence and a go-getter attitude are my lessons from my failure.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2e3,1i05t7y,Need Advice: Equity Split for a Key Team Member in a Startup,"
Hi all, 

I've come here to look for some honest advice. I'm a startup founder and in a tricky spot on what equity percentage to give to my CTO. Ive consulted a few folks, but thought I would come here to maybe get some new perspectives. Thanks in advance for your responses.

Our startup is currently a pre-revenue workflow automation tool with strong leads in logistics, real estate, and tech. We'll likely have our 3 first subscribers this month. There are currently around $30k angel commitments at $10M valuation, and the MVP/platform has been extensively built by myself.

I am the founder who built the initial platform and bootstrapped the entire company through savings and competition winnings, I am 22. My COO holds 10% equity if he goes full-time after our raise and is crucial for outreach and legal work with months of commitment. He's been doing a fantastic job. We have a strategic advisor with 0.5% equity. We have a new team member who joined 1 month ago, and we are currently discussing 15-20% equity for him. All equity has a 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting.

This new team member originally agreed to come onboard with 10% equity a lead engineer, but he let me know now that he feels his worth is not at this level and he's becoming more of a co-founder. I counter offered 15%, and he requested 20%. For context, he is performing exceptionally with strong technical delivery, excellent client communication, preventing my own technical burnout (which I really really struggled with in the past), and showing customer-facing skills with true co-founder potential. Adding him has been one of my best decisions, and he's a real force multiplier. I should also note that I am paying both good market rate salaries.

I've had previous tough experiences with many different engineers who I recruited for the project, making his combination of skills hard to replace. We work really well together, he has a great work ethic, and he genuinely passionate and excited about what we're working on.

I'm currently sorting through three possible options regarding this equity dilema.

The case for 15%: equity to him hinges on industry norms and setting precedents. Typically, for a CTO joining a startup at our stage, especially after the MVP is developed and some funding has been secured, 15% is within standard ranges. This percentage respects the contributions of the early team by not disproportionately diluting the equity pool for those who took on higher initial risk. It also aligns with our current position where we've secured angel commitments and are on the cusp of gaining subscribers, suggesting a lower risk profile for him at this point. 

The case for 17.5%: The argument here is about finding a compromise that acknowledges his exceptional skills while still considering the broader team and future equity needs (for example for hires).

The case for agreeing to 20%: honestly this in my head is justified by the immediate vulnerability in our development process and the significant business risk associated with potentially losing him. His role has grown to embody true co-founder potential, not only in technical leadership but also in strategic direction and client relations. His departure would not only halt our momentum but could also lead to significant setbacks in our product delivery and market positioning. Offering 20% equity would be a strategic move to secure his long-term commitment, banking on his ability to drive substantial value creation for the company, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders through an increased valuation.

The core tension remains to me between business risk, where we could loose a crucial co-founder-level player at a critical time, vs structure risk, where we are setting precedents and maintaining appropriate equity balance.",startups,1736741895.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i05t7y/need_advice_equity_split_for_a_key_team_member_in/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d2e4,1i056ik,16 years old and thinking about creating a startup,"

Hi to everyone, this is my first post on Reddit and r/Startups. Sorry in advance if there is any mistake.

I'm 16 years old, and I'm already planning to create my startup. Growing up in the digital age has given me both inspiration and doubts. On one side, you hear advice like, “You need connections with powerful people to succeed.” On the other, there are stories of founders coming from poverty and now leading billion-dollar companies.That really sucks. I'm here because I believe this community offers honest and grounded insights.

So you can analyze, I leave you my goals. I accept all the advice you have.

I’ll finish high school in two years while using my free time to learn about AI, programming, agile methods, and business basics. After that, I plan to pursue a Systems Engineering degree, even though I’ve debated skipping university. My older siblings convinced me it’s worth it for the professional and technical foundation. During college, I aim to freelance, save money, and build connections with entrepreneurs and developers. Beyond that, my 15-year plan includes working in tech companies to gain experience, creating an MVP for my startup, and securing funding through investors or incubators. I want to solve real-world problems using tools that feel future-proof. While I sometimes feel behind, I’m determined to catch up and take advantage of the opportunities ahead.

I know the startup journey is uncertain—like a vulnerable animal facing competition, funding issues, and market challenges. But I’m ready to adapt as my vision evolves. Like for example the time. Obviously I would like to keep it exactly but you never know what can happen along the way. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts or advice. Thanks in advance, and I apologize if anything is unclear

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2e5,1i041zj,Early-Stage Startup Founder: Is It Too Soon to Approach Angel Investors?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a Lithuanian national, and I’m proud to say that doing business in Lithuania is quite efficient. We have a thriving startup ecosystem here, supported by government accelerators, networking events, and various forms of government assistance e.t.c. In fact, most of my friends and family work in tech or startups. I’m fortunate to call one of my closest friends a mentor—someone who has already successfully built a global business.

This brings me to why I’m sharing this. I’m currently in a great position: I work for a company that has recently started expanding into the German market, and I’m one of the people driving that expansion. At the same time, I’ve started developing my own startup, and I already have a small but dedicated team onboard.

However, I’m facing a few challenges. First, I can only pay salaries to a limited extent right now, so most of the work is being done on a freelance basis. Second, I’m already working over 60+ hours a week (at my current job), which is beginning to take its toll.

My mentor has advised me to start looking for an angel investor as soon as I have a clear vision for my business—which I now do. However, I’m also worried about managing both my full-time job and my startup at the same time. On one hand, I’m expecting a raise at my current job in February, which is great. On the other hand, I don’t want to feel stuck doing something I’m not truly passionate about.

So here’s my question: considering that Lithuania and the Baltics are known for efficiency, and that I already have a strong network, a clear vision, a solid business plan, and a great team, should I start seeking investment while still developing the product? Or should I wait until the product is finished and then present it to investors?

2. For Fundraising

Are Stripe Atlas and Clerky services good enough to be able to achieve what I need to do?

I’m a solo founder working on a niche project in the Tesla space. My platform connects buyers and sellers of used Teslas in France. The idea is simple: sellers pay to post their ad on my site, and buyers can sign up for free to receive curated listings via a newsletter.

I thought it was a straightforward concept, but marketing has turned out to be way more challenging than I expected.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:
	
1.	Google Ads: I targeted “Tesla for sale” keywords, but the cost-per-click is high, and conversions are low.
	
2.	Facebook Groups: Many Tesla-focused groups don’t allow promotional posts, so I can’t directly promote my platform.
	
3.	SEO: I’ve started writing blog posts to drive organic traffic, but I know this will take months before it makes an impact.

So far, I’ve gotten around 60 newsletter signups, which is a start, but I’m struggling to scale beyond that.

Here’s where I could use your advice:
	
• How do you attract sellers (or buyers) without relying heavily on paid ads?
	
• Are there creative ways to tap into niche communities (like Tesla owners) without breaking rules or spamming?
	
• Have you had success with marketing a paid product in a super-specific niche?

- Posts that don't get immediate likes/comments get buried
- Without visibility, our posts with valuable insights and announcements get lost, and our profile isn't taken seriously by potential leads or collaborators, thus weakening our outreach efforts
- If your connections/friends don't actively use LinkedIn like other SM platforms, it's even harder to gain traction

Yeah, I understand posting on LinkedIn can be cringeworthy, and most people are just posting for the sake of it. But let's be real – there are a lot of businesses that don't just want, but NEED a strong LinkedIn presence.

This lack of engagement can be discouraging, leading to infrequent posting and a weaker profile. It's a vicious cycle: Low engagement → fewer posts → weaker profile → harder to attract attention

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2f5,1hzkovw,I might need some help/insights on this.,"Hi guys,

So I’m on the process of finishing up my Agri-business export platform which will be blockchain powered two-sided marketplace that connects Vendors (suppliers who register to sell their agricultural products.) and clients (Buyers who will be purchasing the said products).

So here are some issues that have been troubling me and for those who've built two-sided marketplace platforms please help me out here:

1. **Chicken and egg question:** I have been thinking while finishing up, i should approach Clients first to get them into the platform by offering them Free for 100 weeks to any Client who will sign up for the next 120 days. 
2. **Type of commission:** My platform will operate in  market where most of exports activities are done traditional and there are small to none competitors who offer a platform that offers full supply chain service (smart contracts, custom market reports and a supply chain management service). So I was thinking of bundling up all this services and include them within the commission or should I put them as add-on-services?

3. **Marketplace leakage:** I think most people who operated marketplaces before have encountered this problem, where clients and vendors go offsite to transact or connect to each other. How did you prevent this?

So I understand that there is subsidizing one side of a marketplace to attract the other, but what about doing both until critical mass, is it achievable?

For those who've faced similar challenges: What strategies worked for your platform to overcome this please advise

I know that as a founder you won't be able to take a huge salary but my family is in a tough financial situation. I also have a job opportunity at big4( started job hunting for the past 2 weeks cause I didn't see any progress ) , The 9-5 would be so helpful for my financial condition right now. One possibility is  I could invest some part of my salary into the startup as well but that would be slow.    
For context, I would need at least 14 clients just to breakeven with the job offer I have in hand. So to have a decent revenue I would need to have 50+ clients working with startup. It's a B2B model.   
What should I do? Should I take the investment? Run this in parallel with my 9-5?

Edit: I don't think getting 50 clients is hard. It was just to give a perspective on what a decent client size would be to consider it early success. ",startups,1736675918.0,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hzjji7/should_i_take_the_investment/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d2f7,1hzh3ml,Looking for Collaborators to Build an AI-Driven Travel Itinerary &amp; Booking Platform 🚀,"**Hi everyone!**

I’m working on an idea for an AI-powered travel platform that could revolutionize how we plan and book multi-modal journeys. Imagine entering two locations, like *Chandigarh to Raipur*, and the platform instantly suggests:

1. All **transport modes** (train, flight, bus, metro, taxi, etc.).

2. The **cheapest** and **fastest** combinations (e.g., “Flight to Delhi, then a metro, and finally a train to Chandigarh”).

3. The **cost**, **time**, and a direct link for **ticket booking**.

4. Recommendations optimized for **user preferences** (budget, convenience, or minimal transfers).



The platform will combine structured data from APIs (IRCTC, RedBus, Google Flights) with an AI agent that can perform **web searches** for unstructured data (e.g., local transport schedules or smaller operators). It’s like having an **AI travel agent** that finds and plans everything for you!

  
**Why This is Exciting**

1. **Convenience**: No more juggling multiple websites for tickets or schedules.

2. **Personalization**: Tailored recommendations based on your preferences.

3. **Innovation**: It could evolve into a global platform integrating transport, lodging, and more.

  
**Who I’m Looking For**

I’m passionate about building this but need collaborators to bring it to life! Specifically:

• **Backend Developers**: Expertise in Python, API integration, and route optimization algorithms.

• **Frontend Developers**: Someone skilled in React or Flutter for a seamless user experience.

• **Data Scientists/AI Engineers**: To build the optimization engine and AI agent for unstructured data.

• **Travel Enthusiasts**: People with ideas to make the platform better or connections with travel APIs/operators.

  
**Why Join Me?**

• **Early-Stage Opportunity**: Get in on the ground floor of a project with massive potential.we can be partner and you can equity in the company

• **Flexible Collaboration**: Open to part-time or full-time contributors, depending on your availability.

• **Shared Vision**: I’m open to brainstorming and refining the idea together.

I (27m) was just curious what jobs y'all did to make ends meet while you were exploring your startup. Do we have any bartenders / service industry folks in here? I've been pursuing my startup for a while and I haven't gotten true product-market fit yet. But we're getting good enough user feedback to warrant pushing a little further and working on it some more. We are in the nightlife industry. 

What did you do to pay for everything  when you were in the early days? How old were you? What did you do? 

I'm in an awkward spot where I don't really need a lot of money to build my startup (which is awesome) but I need time to go out and talk to clients / users and market. I actually just quit my job as the General Manager of a fast food restaurant because I was working 70-80hrs (mostly nights) and just didn't have the time to spend with our users and clients who work during the same time.

Job hunting right now. I have degree in CS, lots of experience as the GM of family style and fast-food service, large scale event planning (1000+ attendees events for Fortune 500 companies) and contract development. I've been looking for contract development jobs because honestly I'm just not getting hits on any programming roles, like I'll get interviews and then the interviews get cancelled. That's actually why I took the fast-food GM job, just needed something because I don't have a ridiculous amount in savings to just not do anything and focus on the startup.

Anyways, now I'm looking around and was just wondering if anyones related to this. I'm sure a few have. Any other service industry people here? Or people who have kinda gotten stuck in the service industry?  I have to find a job to pay my personal bills but I need the time to dedicate to my startup evenings / weekends. Trying to stay out of food service but its where a bulk of my experience has been in the past two years. Programming roles haven't been getting hits, and I'm only 27 and the business roles I've found just don't pay enough (my bills are $3,990/month - I don't really go out / spend money on myself. This includes my startups expenses). 

I guess I'm just feeling discouraged with job prospects and looking for connection through experience.",startups,1736653374.0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hzdyfx/what_job_did_you_have_while_you_were_starting_out/

I’m working on a new idea for my website, where I share daily deals to help people save money, and I’d love to get your feedback.

The concept:
In 2025, I want to launch a community challenge to save €10,000 together in one year! 💰

Here’s how it works:

	•	I share daily deals that help people save money.

	•	Community members can share their own savings or even submit deals they’ve found.

	•	I’ll track and share weekly updates on how much we’ve saved as a group.

	•	Bonus: Users can upload their own deals on my website and earn a commission if others use them.

The goal is to grow awareness of my website and drive more traffic while creating an interactive and fun challenge for people who love saving money.

My questions for you:

1️⃣ Do you think this kind of challenge would resonate with a target audience that loves deals and saving?

2️⃣ How would you approach this to encourage maximum engagement and participation?

3️⃣ Would you personally take part in such a challenge, and why (or why not)?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d2ff,1hz2ygy,Mom test for hiring marketing interns ,"Yes I'm thinking of hiring a marketing intern for my startup. I know the dangers and risks. Especially given that it will be a paid one. 

However, I believe in taking chances. Most full time employees are not great either.. problem with hiring anyone in an early stage is a rather simple one.. most employees look for job to live a good life. Very rarely would you find someone genuinely interested in helping your startup survive, let alone grow. 

Back to the point, I'm going to evaluate a few candidates. Turns out even graduated folks are applying. Now comes the difficult part. How do I evaluate their motivation? 

I'm promoting the job post to get a hell lot of candidates. And I plan to interview some 20-50 of them. That's a lot of time but could get me some good ROI.. if I find the right guy

The job will be mostly in sales.. going door to door to market our product. I mean emailing, calling, then setting up meeting etc. 

What kind of questions could help me identify the right person? If only I had a Donna (Suits tv series) to wink at me from the waiting room. To signal that this is a different guy, a Mike Ross (would actually love to hire someone with fake degrees but street smart... Degrees from ivy leagues and work experience don't really help)

Makes things difficult.. makes me wonder if there are better ways to evaluate their motivation. 
Some candidates send linked in invites after their application, which I take as signal of high interest. But that might be pretty naive. Sightly better,  'easy apply' are 'easy ignore'. Only those who email a cover letter or do make extra efforts are worth any time.

Do great startups have some proven techniques? After all hiring is an important skill for successful founders.
 
Motivation letters are pretty useless.. filled with standard phrases, no real content. Some sort of mom test could work here? 

PS: this is pretty usual Reddit thing to mock anyone asking for advice. One out of ten comments are helpful nevertheless.. the rest 90 pc mocking the author worthless

I’m building a start-up called Foodable, which takes your ingredients and leftovers and, using AI and the creator economy, provides personalised, user-generated, video-first recipes based on them and your preferences.

Currently, I have a web concept that shows TikTok videos based on user-provided ingredients. It has over 2k people using it and some promising engagement. My next big step is to raise funding (starting with Angels) to take Foodable to the next level. However, I’m torn between two potential strategies and would love your advice.

**Option 1:** Iterate the Web Concept

* Add 1-2 key features (e.g., dietary filters or improved video suggestions).
* Introduce a small paywall (e.g., £0.99/month) to validate whether people are willing to pay for what we’ve built.
* Use this validation to pitch Angels for funding, with the focus of building a more robust app version.

**Option 2:** Build the App Version

* Bring someone on board to build the app (I have no coding experience).
* Shift away from TikTok videos and instead allow users to upload their own recipes.
* Use funding to iterate and improve the app after launch.

I feel like validation is key to attracting Angels, but I’m not sure if it’s better to focus on proving willingness to pay with the web concept or build a more polished app version right away.

I've interviewed about 10 candidates so far, and it has given me a lot of signal for skill. Especially for those without substantial side projects. In my experience, those who do worse on the interview, also do worse on the job. 

Don't trust experience, always interview. I brought on one guy for a bit, who interned at 2 small startups before. He had interesting github projects and was friendly. But he was too slow. He wasn't able to google effectively. I had brought him on before I started doing interviews, and had to let him go (nicely ofc).

It's especially helpful too, now that I've switched to also looking for offshore devs. Committed, entrepreneurial devs that are willing to risk time and effort, are rare as diamonds in my exp. This week I just hired 2 offshore devs, who did well in the interview, and they are showing good signs. They're writing medium complexity code, and communicating properly.

My current interview method is to open up my product's codebase on vscode, and have the candidate use the live share extension to get access to my vscode instance. They the  share their screen as they code. They also open up localhost:3000 on their end and see the site, since live share creates a tunnel from my pc to theirs.

I have them solve it small ticket on the codebase I did a month ago, took me 30min. I have not touched that part of the codebase before so I think it's fair. 99% of the codebase was not written by me. I give them 45 min to just to copy a button from one part of the page to another. Competent people are able to navigate their way through it fast.

This has worked relatively well, but they lose their own keyboard shortcuts, or even IDE in one case (he used webstorm).

I was wondering if anyone knows of a small ticket on an open source codebase that would work well over 30mins? I know of many open source projects, but would appreciate any pointers to ones that are a react webapp. Just a frontend ticket would also be fine, since for our codebase, complexity leans more on the frontend.",startups,1736609371.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hyya16/technical_founders_how_do_you_interview_candidates/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d313,1hybtge,Question on bringing in a strategic company before pre-seed funding. ,"I’m seeking advice on a big decision for my startup. I’ve built a marketplace platform (MVP complete, pre-revenue) that connects local government officials with GovTech companies to streamline technology adoption.

A potential strategic partner has offered $15,000 in exchange for 25% equity. Here’s what they bring to the table:

**Extensive network:** They lead an association and have deep connections with local government officials. This would be a free sign up for officials.   
  
**Value Add:** Their involvement could drive government officials to the platform, making it more attractive to paying GovTech companies.

Here’s my dilemma:

**Pros** Their network could help jumpstart the marketplace and attract paying clients.  
  
**Cons:** 25% feels like a significant chunk for $15,000 at this stage, especially since I’ve built the platform solo.

I’d love your thoughts on:

1.	Is this a fair trade-off for the stage I’m at?  
  
2.	Should I structure the deal differently (e.g., milestone-based equity or SAFE note)?

* **The Business Setup**: My co-founder and I are building a startup together. She’s spent over a year doing the business setup—customer interviews, meeting brands, and paying for branding and fees. She estimates about 15 hours/week and around $8,000 in expenses.
* **My Contribution**: I’m the technical co-founder and developed the iOS app for the business. I’ve put in 140 hours (Sept–Dec 2023), and based on developer rates, my work has saved the company $10,000–$17,500.

**The Split**:  
We’ve agreed on a 51%/49% split, where she holds the majority stake. She feels my app development work matches her time contribution, but she’s asking me to also match her $8,000 in cash to equalize our equity.

She’s proposed a payment schedule where I’d pay 25% of the $8,000 each year over four years (aligned with the vesting of my restricted units).

**My Dilemma**:  
I originally thought my app development would count as my full contribution to the business, and I wouldn’t need to pay cash on top of that. However, I understand her point of view—she sees her $8,000 as separate from her time investment, so she’s asking me to match that financially.

**What I’m Wondering**:

1. Is it fair to ask for my development time to offset the $8,000 completely? Or is it reasonable to treat her cash expenses and my app work as separate contributions?
2. Should I just agree to the payment schedule for simplicity and to maintain the partnership?
3. How have other co-founders handled situations where one contributes technical skills and the other handles business setup?

I want to make sure both of us feel our contributions are valued and avoid any resentment in the future. Any advice or similar experiences would be super helpful!

Looking back, I realize it would’ve been ideal to finalize these details before I started working on the app, but at the time, we were both just eager to get things moving. Now I want to make sure we address it fairly and avoid any misunderstandings later.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d318,1hy6j26,My Journey on building YouTube Automation Program..,"This program of mine that I created from scratch isn't about bots.. it's of scheduling your short videos in not only 1 channel, but multiple channels of yours..

More like an alternative to SaaS apps out in the public , this program would solely be a one time payment of much cheaper and efficient cost.

As the title says..
My journey was simple and straightforward, I wanted to make a simple program in python, seeing my younger bro struggle to maintain a YouTube channel.. and after so much manual hardwork, he would hardly get 1k views on his shorts and 2-3 subs from a video...

Then that was the day I decided to build something.. I'm just a 18yo drop guy who missed opportunities to join medical college this year (2024) , and within this free time, I've learnt a bit of coding through basic courses, learnt about GUIs , mechanisms of how coding works.. and I've finally been able to create my dream project..

It began with a simple idea, of a program that runs through terminals and not even GUI.. then I thought to add some GUI to it, so as a beginner I chose tkinter which seemed kind of easy to learn imo.. after the gui was done.. another idea popped up in my head when I was unconsciously between 'going to sleep' phase in the midnight...
Next day morning, I've reasearched the hell out of coding.. and finally added a mechanism to manage multiple channels, ie. Scheduling via the program automatically... You just need to add time schedules and it takes the rest of the work and upload videos everyday on that scheduled time.. the videos will be picked up from the assigned channel's folder and later will be flagged as uploaded to prevent re-uploading...
Everything works between the user's pc and youtube servers itself...
And also fetches channel's analytics to display in the program too!

So yeahh, after shit ton of idea popups, revisions of codes and MUCH MOREE! 

I finally present to you guys, the

 ShortiumPoppy Automation Program!(THIS IS NOT A PROMOTION)

If you like , yall can check the software 's videos on youtube @ShortiumPoppy

I just hope this project of YouTube Automation makes people's lives easier!
Hoping for the best for the program in the future.

And hope so this drop I got from going to my desired medical college really will pay me off.. improving me and others..❤️

I honestly don’t even know what things to consider other than tax.

YC always says Delaware, but have things changed recently?

Am I getting taxed way less if I’m C in Texas?
Any downside do operating in multiple states if I’m Texas C v Delaware C?

I'm launching a beta of my B2C platform. I decided 2025 would be a year of stealth growth as I gain my first customers, understand their problems and likes/dislikes, and build something we all like while I do it on the side with my day job that pays the bills for at least another year (hoping to go in full-time later in 2026)

A got an email out of the blue from a respectable publication that wants to cover my launch, although I don't think they know it's a beta launch. My first reaction was ""Wow!"" but the more I thought about it the more it felt too early.

**Pros:**

* I do not have many users yet and I think a publication would absolutely solve my early user acq issues

**Cons:**

* With my day job, I really only have 2 to 3 hours a day to work on this project
* I want to remain stealth without a target on my back
* If I had to choose a time to get coverage, it's when I have the necessary processes in place which I don't

I’ve always been cautious about taking on debt, even though my bank consistently offers me up to $150k in funding that I could access in just a few days. So far, I’ve never taken them up on it—something about it feels risky, or maybe it’s just me being stubborn.

Lately, though, I’ve started questioning myself. Am I being too conservative? Should I be leveraging debt to grow faster, or is it smart to avoid it and stick to my bootstrapped strategy?

To be honest, I can’t help but feel like an impostor sometimes when I see other businesses scaling aggressively and making big moves. I wonder if I’m holding myself back unnecessarily or if this cautious approach is actually the right move for my business.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d32f,1hxntch,How to refine a Profile's forms without losing engagement or creating inconsistent data between old and new profiles?,"# Context

We’re running a beta for a website that uses AI to match therapists with patients. The process works like this:

1. Therapists fill out profiles by answering specific questions about their therapy approach.
2. Patients describe their issues, and our AI suggests the best therapist matches by ""reading"" their profiles.

During our beta test, we contacted around 100 therapists where 40 registered and only 20 completed their profiles. Note that the sign-up process has some friction because questions about the therapy approach might require time and critical thinking from some therapists, but this depth is crucial for quality matches.

# Problem

We're facing a dilemma with our therapist profiles and how to do the following at the same time:

1. **Recruiting more therapists:** this is critical because it's what makes the platform grow and makes us more appealing to both patients and potential new therapists.
2. **Iterating on the profiles:** to improve the quality of AI matches, we need to refine the questions in the profile form. This means asking existing therapists to answer new questions (which is a frictional process) and if they don't do it, we risk having an inconsistent database where different profiles contain different sets of information (i.e. new profiles would have the new questions, and old profiles the old questions), harming our algorithm's ability to match patients effectively.

The more we recruit, the more this inconsistency could scale and undermine our platform’s value.

# What we are asking

We’re looking for solutions to navigate these challenges without losing engagement from therapists or compromising the quality of our database. Specifically, we’d love to hear your thoughts on:

* How to encourage existing therapists to update their profiles as we iterate on questions.
* Strategies to avoid inconsistent profiles when adding or changing questions.
* Ways to reduce friction in completing profiles while maintaining the depth of information needed for quality AI matches.
* Tips for improving the therapist acquisition funnel to increase registrations and profile completion rates.

He literally said in a meeting a joke about sleeping with someone's wife. I couldn't believe that. I mean i get joking but saying something like that goes beyond the workplace.

He hasn't done anything to me personally but he has said some pretty surprising things in front of me like mentioned above and also his outlook on some of the other people in the company, it's just plain toxic and disrespectful.

Now, we provide a web app for customers to complete their simple tasks and provide custom solutions for the customers who need them.



At Potarix, we’re using AI. Initially, our thesis was that AI messes up a lot, so let's launch a service where we do jobs for people and use AI internally to be equivalent to 100s of engineers doing the same work. However, this idea led to a few issues:



1. Lessened scalability - Our product wasn’t plug-and-play. You couldn’t just log onto a website and start using it. This deterred people from using our product as they had to put a request in and go through multiple steps before seeing results.



1. The company is seen as equivalent to a freelancing agency - People compared Potarix to freelancing agencies. Some potential customers often wanted to keep everything in-house and ruled out outsourcing their work. We couldn't capture a significant amount of the market share due to this issue.



1. Slacking on product development - This might be more of a personal thing, but when we were acting as a service, we neglected our in-house product because if our AI messed up we could manually fix the issue. Switching to a SAAS forced us to make our AI as good as possible. 



All that being said, many of our customers want a custom service to handle their scraping tasks, so we’re still doing that for some clients.

It hasn't been properly implemented into any form that I or my associates have been able to find and I believe that now is the perfect time to start its development.

I'm an entrepreneur, have started several successful companies over the years and am well experienced in all things business. But, none of my companies have involved creating a brand new product or would fall into the ""Startup"" category. It's a whole new world to me.

That being said, I'm not sure what the proper steps are to make this idea come to fruition and am hoping for a point in the right direction. How do people usually go from idea to launch?

I imagine there are 2 distinct things I need right now, funding for the project and a partner to help create the software.

Step 1 would be the partner. For this partner, I'm not sure where to start to find this person. I'd imagine I need someone that's experienced in machine learning, AI engineering, software development, programming, etc. Or a combination of people with those skills. Since none of my companies are startup or tech based, I don't have connections to anyone with those skills.

If I go around looking for a partner with those skills, I'll surely need to explain my idea to them and will need to be able to protect my idea before hand. Do I copyright it? Make them sign an NDA? What's common business practice?

Where do I go to look for a partner with those skills?

For funding, I can fund the initial stages of the project for a handful of months. From there, I'd like to find some kind of investment. But that sounds like a bridge to cross when I get further down that road.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d346,1hwy2zo,Things I Wish I Knew Before Selling My 8+ Figure Company (And What I'm Learning Now) ,"I wanted to share some reflections on my journey as an entrepreneur, selling my company, and what I’ve learned since. I hope it resonates with anyone building something meaningful or thinking about an exit. Here’s my story and a few hard-earned lessons.

My Story

I’m a registered nurse who bootstrapped and scaled a home health company from scratch. In just three years, I grew the business to 200 employees and was the sole owner. Last year, I sold the company to a publicly traded corporation.

At first, it felt like the ultimate milestone. But after a few months without a daily work routine, I’ve realized selling your business changes a lot—but not everything. Here’s what I wish I knew before the exit and what I’m learning after.

5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Selling My Business

1. Selling doesn’t change who you are.
You built your business because you had a vision, a mission, and a relentless drive. Selling doesn’t suddenly switch off that entrepreneurial fire. If anything, you’ll miss the satisfaction of building something meaningful. A sale won’t magically feel like a vacation for life. That drive to build something great will still be there—but it won’t feel the same as creating your first successful company.


2. Learn about C Corps and the QSBS tax exemption.
This one’s huge. If you set up your company as a C Corp and hold the equity for more than 5 years, you can potentially save millions by avoiding capital gains tax under the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) rules. I wish someone had told me this earlier—it’s life-changing advice for founders. (I had an LLC sitting around 2 years prior that I used when I started my former company, which I could have made it applied but couldn't due to QSBS rules)


3. Have a clear plan for what’s next.
Before selling, get brutally honest with yourself. Why are you selling? What will you do after? Would it make sense to keep growing the company, hire more help, and aim for a higher EBITDA multiplier later? Or are you truly ready to move on? Without a clear plan, the post-sale “freedom” can feel disorienting.


4. Hire more help instead of maxing profits.
In hindsight, I should’ve prioritized my mental health and hired a strong leadership team to reduce my day-to-day stress. This would’ve allowed me to take an actual break, recharge, and return with fresh energy. Instead, I focused on staying as profitable as possible, which came at a personal cost - selling the business due to this stressful atmosphere in combination with a nice payout.


5. Selling isn’t the finish line—it’s the start of something new.
Make sure you’ve thought about what life after the sale looks like. The “end” of your company is really just the beginning of a new chapter for you.

5 Things I’m Learning Now Post-Exit

1. Slow down and embrace the unknown.
For years, I was in full-on hustle mode, with every day planned out. Now, I’m learning to enjoy the freedom of not knowing what each day holds. It’s a weird adjustment, but it’s also a chance to rediscover yourself.


2. Find a community of like-minded people.
Few people understand what it’s like to build and sell a business. Find a group of other entrepreneurs or post-exit founders who’ve walked a similar path. You’ll need people who get it.


3. Meet as many interesting people as possible.
This is my current goal. Building relationships with other curious, ambitious, and thoughtful people is enriching in ways I didn’t expect.


4. Be slow to invest your money.
You don’t need to chase maximized returns right out of the gate. Right now, I’m learning to take it slow, develop a thoughtful plan, and steward the proceeds from the sale responsibly. You worked too hard to blow it on risky moves.


5. It’s okay to just be.
For years, I was wired to achieve, build, and optimize. Now, I’m learning that it’s okay to pause, reflect, and simply be in the moment.

---

I hope this helps anyone thinking about selling or navigating life after an exit. If you’ve gone through something similar, I’d love to hear what you’ve learned!

In the meantime, I'm calling this weird phase I am in a ""family sabbatical"". I'm married with 3 kids, and another on the way.

Send me a DM - I love meeting fellow entrepreneurs.

Cheers to a great 2025 and thanks for reading.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d347,1hwy12m,Hot take: please don't join a pre-PMF startup,"Hi all, I got inspired on the topic by Gagan Biyani's (Cofounder of Maven &amp; Udemy) recent post—it is a read worth your time! (will add links in the comments due to r/startups' policy)

I wanted to share my perspective on the question since I wish I had read this back when I was making pivotal career choices. I have nothing to sell, and I will speak my truth as if I were talking to a dear younger cousin.

**My take is simple**: If you're smart-hardworking-ambitious, I beg you: never work for a pre-product-market-fit startup.  
**Why**: most pre-PMF startups fail, and even if they succeed it's unclear you'll fairly benefit from it.  
**Instead**: work for post-PMF companies, whatever stage you're comfortable with, rake in money + xp + brand + quality lifestyle -&gt; then climb the corporate ladder and/or start your own startup.

**Why?**

(about me: multiple years in pre-PMF startup, in very successful high-growth post-PMF startup, and as co-founder)

**1. Odds of success are extremely low.**

We all wish we'd join the next big thing. But startup life is cruel, only a handful of companies actually become successful. A few reach PMF. And among them, even fewer reach a couple of million in revenue.

Pre-PMF, it’s close to impossible to tell which will succeed—so much so that even professional investors fail all the time at this game.

Why?

**A.** Fundamentally most startup folks (founders or employees) are optimistic gold diggers—we *want* to believe in the story.

**B.** Founders are professional liars - they need to paint a good story to investors and employees to hype you up, and they will never admit they're just faking it until they make it. They're probably better at bullshitting than you are at cutting through the BS (otherwise you'd be an investor or a founder :). The best founders even exert a ""reality distorsion field"": they will push the right levers within you and convince you of pretty much anything – even though the data can tell a very different story (stagnant growth / no revenue / no avenue for profitability). Success will always be *around the corner*, and weeks, months, years can go by like this, without you realizing you're tied to a zombie startup.

Yet here you are, early-stage startup employees, busting your ass, for a fleeting odd of success.

**2. You will be exploited**

From experience, founders are very intense and selfish sons of b\*\*ches (I've been one). They have decided to commit 100% to this thing. And they will push you to do the same. The upside is life-changing for them – most likely, not for you.

They will promote toxic work culture: working 10+ hrs a day, at night, on weekends, taking close to no vacations. They will hype this as ""we go hard"", ""we're navy seals"", ""we're like a family"", ""unlimited PTO policy"", and other shallow bullshit. They will indeed *lead by example*: working all sorts of hours, not respecting your personal boundaries, texting/calling you 24/7, taking no days off. Actively or passively, you'll feel guilt-tripped to try to have a regular work schedule. How could you not? Everybody in the company is an enthused cult member.

Truth be told, they're just sucking out your soul like f\*\*ing Dementors. You're losing more than you're winning from living like this. Startups are built atop the corpses of smart and loyal employees.

Your friends in bigger orgs are making more money than you, growing their scope / salaries faster, all this while working a peaceful 9-to-5, enjoying hobbies and traveling on the weekends.

But you're probably thinking: ""no bro, I'm learning a sh\*tton! I'm becoming a machine!""  
Not really.

**3. You will not learn as much as they dangle**

By working that much, you're indeed producing stuff.  
But are you really learning to do it following industry *best practices*?  
Odds are, you're ""moving fast and breaking things"", which is often a glorified way of saying you're *half-assing*. Since you're pushed to go faster and faster, it's the only way around. All the rest is considered a waste of time by the founders.

In theory, it's not a big problem. The book goes like: startups go fast, reach PMF, then clean technical/org debt and become more structured, reach profitability and then exit.

Here's the problem **for you** though: even if your startup reaches PMF (rare occurrence), founders will most likely bring *adult supervision* for the next stage of the company – people from FAANG-like companies, with managerial experience.

You thought you were a family, that you'd grow alongside the company, and that your efforts would be fairly rewarded when success finally happened - by becoming the lead, head of, CxO. But in reality, you were just the simp they were exploiting, and now they will give that sweet position and total comp to someone they actually look up to and think they have something to learn from: your normie college roommate who has the Google/McKinsey stamp on their resume. Founders like to pretend they're unfazed by these credentials, but when push comes to shove, they often choose this type of people, with a pat on the back from their normie investors.

Please don't think it's a personal vendetta: I'm not only speaking from personal experience, I've seen this happen too many times for me to count, both for my FAANG friends happy to ""exit to an early stage startup"", and to my early-stage fellows pissed to now have to report to a sophisticated schmoozer they usually have no respect for. I'm happy to admit there are counterexamples, some first guys at Facebook, Uber, Slack - who climbed the ladder and managed to FIRE (achieve Financial Independence and Retire Early) post-IPO. These guys are a statistical error - I urge you to not make your life's most important decisions based on their stories.

How did you get there???  
**A. No coaching**  
In general in pre-PMF, no one is available to **actively coach** you, which is imho the best way to grow.  
Cofounders are way too busy hustling - and they might not even have the skillset to teach you your craft (e.g., you're the first designer or ML person in the org).  
**B. Diffuse role**  
Jacks-of-all-trades are valued in startups. You will sign for a ML role, but actually you'll also do data engineering, MLops, and probably some software engineering. It's all fine and dandy – but you're not becoming the best at anything. Meaning you're not competitive to rise to a leadership role in your current org, let alone aim for a senior position in a FAANG. I get you, you might find it boring to be put in a box by a large corp, but that's what they need, and your main skill of *being a generalist who goes fast but in a non-clean way* is a no-no for these large corps.  
It's kind of ironic - not only will the ""ex-Google/McKinsey/..."" get the best job in your startup, but you won't be able to join Google either.  
**C. Result: you're not the best**  
It's kind of sad, but if we're being honest, the FAANG guy is probably better suited than you to actually run the show. You've worked hard - but for the Zimbabwe army (no disrespect 🇿🇼). They've worked less hard - but for the special forces.

Personally, I feel that in a pre-PMF startup I mostly unlearned all the best practices I had invested efforts to learn in larger orgs, all that for dubious results.

**4. You won't make a lot of money (even in case of success)**

This one is pretty straightforward.

Early stage startups generally pay low in cash and somewhat liberally in stock options (""hope-money""). But if the stock never skyrockets, your options are worth nil.

I think it's kind of cruel, but even if the company's valuation actually skyrockets, you're not likely to substantially benefit from it. You probably have &lt;3% equity pre-Series A. Not only will it take 5-10 years to mature to a potential cash exit for you, but these 3% will melt faster than butter on a hot pan.

People who know what they're doing—investors, and sometimes repeat founders who learned their lesson the hard way the first time—have all sorts of contractual provisions to get preferential equity treatment: they can sell secondary shares during fundraising rounds, get their cash back first in case of acquisition, have anti-dilution protections, etc. Meanwhile, you're naively signing the standard ESOP piece of crap your co-founder handed your way like a second-hand car salesman closing a deal.

Mind you, that's the *success* scenario.

Meanwhile, your FAANG friends – whose base salary is already higher – get RSUs (they don't have to pay to purchase the stocks, but you pre-PMF peasant will have to purchase your stock options if you ever want to activate them) and yearly refreshers, in an almost-guaranteed-to-grow equity.

Let's not even touch on the benefits they're getting but you're not – 401(k) matching, bonuses, awesome health insurance, actual pto &amp; parental leave, and even more than you can think of.

It means that while you're busting your ass off to stay broke - your friends are quietly building their net worth to escape the rat race.

To add insult to injury – it might very well be the case that by waiting for a pre-PMF company to reach PMF, and then joining it post-PMF (less risk) from a brand-name company, you'll have a way better total comp &amp; equity package than the sucker who was here since day 1.

**5. When you leave, you will be relatively undesirable on the job market**

I think it's honestly the saddest part. When you leave this type of company, no employer will care about this no-name startup on your resume and the inordinate amount of effort you invested in it.

Trust me, I've hired so many times both for small and big companies, and most people (co-founders, execs, peers) will prefer the candidate with a brand-name on their resume. It's unfair, but the success of the brand brushes off on them. You might've been a phenomenal crew member, but no one wants to hire an expert in paddleboats.

Even if you find yourself launching a VC-backed venture, you will find out that VCs, the very guys pretending they're friendly with early stage startups, will actually favor the entrepreneurs coming from the brand-name company.

**Conclusion: by and large, you're better off not joining any pre-PMF company**.

**My recommendation**: work for post-PMF companies, whatever stage you're comfortable with, rake in money + xp + brand + quality lifestyle -&gt; then climb the corporate ladder and/or start your own company.

I honestly wish someone would've broken this down for me a few years back. But YC and other propagandists were too good at sexifying the pre-PMF and I fell for it.

I know some of you will brush this post off as coming from a hater/loser. Honestly, it's not even about me. I've seen too many bright and very hard-working friends making the wrong career choices and, 5-10 years later, be way behind financially/career-wise compared to the guys who went post-PMF. This has to stop.

To give you a concrete understanding of what I've built, and to inform this discussion: **untitleddb(dot)com**

To preempt a common question I've gotten in the past: *Why would someone choose your platform over LinkedIn and/or Artstation/DeviantArt/Cara etc?* Here's my response:

UntitledDb is different from LinkedIn because it allows artists to upload a portfolio of their artworks in addition to posting details that would normally appear on their CV. Further, artist CVs include different information than what an office worker would put on their resume, since the nature of the job is so different. This is one point of differentiation; there are others.

UntitledDb is different from Artstation/DeviantArt/Cara because the latter sites function purely as portfolio sites, and are heavily skewed toward digital artists who create ""fan art"" and/or art inspired by anime, fantasy, and video games; my competitors do not cater to traditional/fine artists (i.e. artists who create visual art that is exhibited at/sold by galleries) and allow them to represent themselves in the same way they would be represented by art galleries. Again, this is one point of differentiation; there are others.

**Edit: here is more context:**

My web platform caters to visual artists, curators, art critics, and art institutions like galleries, museums, art foundations, art academies, art press outlets. It can be described as a LinkedIn for the visual art industry.

I am focused on the ""fine art"" industry, i.e. the type of art that is shown and sold at galleries, and that is usually created by artists who have formal training and/or have a practice in which they are consistently creating visual art with the intent to sell it and/or display it in exhibitions.

Initially, I want the platform to appeal to artists who are currently pursuing formal training (i.e. BFA and MFA students who are either in school or have graduated recently), small to medium sized art galleries, grant-issuing art foundations, and popular art press outlets.

My platform offers two subscriptions: a $10/month ""Pro"" subscription that is meant for users looking to promote themselves as individuals operating in the space (e.g. artists, curators, art critics), and a $100/month ""Enterprise"" subscription that is meant for users looking to promote themselves as institutions (e.g. galleries, museums, art foundations, art academies, art press outlets).

Based on the above, I ran the following through GPT as a starting point re: how to think about the market opportunity:

# Estimating Market Size by Segment:

Below is one possible breakdown, focusing primarily on U.S. numbers (as the U.S. often has the most readily available data). You can extrapolate upward if you plan to market globally.

**1. Artists (Students and Early-Career)**

1. **BFA/MFA Students and Recent Graduates**
   * In the U.S., about 80,000–90,000 visual and performing arts **degrees** are conferred each year, per the National Center for Education Statistics. Roughly half or slightly more may be “purely visual arts.”
   * At any given point, the population of current BFA/MFA students plus those who graduated within the last \~5 years can easily reach **150,000–200,000** (just in the U.S.).
2. **Professional Fine Artists**
   * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports around **50,000–60,000** “Fine Artists” (painters, sculptors, illustrators) employed or self-employed in the U.S., but this omits many freelancers or partially employed artists.
   * Factoring in artists who do not show up neatly in BLS data (e.g., part-time but still actively exhibiting, or those making income from side gigs, etc.), a more liberal estimate can reach **100,000–150,000** who might be serious enough to consider a Pro subscription on a professional network.

Combining BFA/MFA students, recent grads, and actively exhibiting artists yields a rough potential of **250,000–350,000** individual artists (U.S. only) who might be interested in a Pro-tier subscription.

**2. Curators and Critics (Individual Professionals)**

* Exact counts are smaller than for artists; curators and critics often overlap with academic or institutional roles.
* As a rough rule of thumb, many estimates place **10,000–20,000** curators/critics/independent art professionals in the U.S. who are at least partly freelance and “visible” in the exhibition/review circuit.
* Most of these would also qualify for a Pro subscription.

Adding **curators + critics** to the earlier artist count suggests around **260,000–370,000** potential individual (Pro-tier) users.

**3. Institutions (Enterprise Tier)**

1. **Galleries**
   * There are widely quoted figures of **4,000–6,000** recognized galleries in the U.S. that consistently represent artists and stage exhibitions. (In major art hubs like NYC, LA, Chicago, etc., the galleries alone can run in the thousands collectively.)
   * Globally, some sources suggest **20,000–40,000** but many are very small or region-specific.
2. **Museums &amp; Art Foundations**
   * The U.S. has around **4,500–5,000** museums (of all types, not just fine art). A subset (in the low thousands) are specifically dedicated to art.
   * Art foundations (i.e., nonprofits granting funding) number in the **hundreds** to low **thousands**.
3. **Art Press Outlets &amp; Academies**
   * Press outlets focusing on art news (online or print) are fewer but still numerous in total. Perhaps **100–300** with any significant circulation in the U.S.
   * Art academies / specialized art schools beyond mainstream BFA/MFA programs might be **200–500**.

So, the **Enterprise-tier** universe might be anywhere from **5,000** on the conservative side (core small-to-mid galleries + select institutions) to **10,000+** if you include more foundations, press outlets, specialized academies, etc. in the U.S.

# U.S.-Focused Totals vs. Global Extrapolation

* **Pro-tier (Individuals)**: **\~260,000–370,000** in the U.S.
* **Enterprise-tier (Institutions)**: **\~5,000–10,000** in the U.S.

If your platform is global and you plan to reach major art markets in Europe, Asia, and beyond, you could **3x–5x** these figures for a rough worldwide total. But to keep it concrete, the above range is a decent ballpark for a U.S. focus.

# Average Deal Size

You have two subscription tiers:

1. **Pro**: $10/month (i.e., $120/year)
2. **Enterprise**: $100/month (i.e., $1,200/year)

An “average deal size” depends on your expected mix of Pro vs. Enterprise users—i.e., if you ended up with 90% Pro and 10% Enterprise, your overall blended average would be higher than $10/month but still much less than $100/month. Here’s a simplified example:

* Suppose out of 100 paying subscribers, 90 choose Pro and 10 choose Enterprise.
* **Pro** total revenue: 90×$12090 \\times \\$12090×$120 = $10,800/year
* **Enterprise** total revenue: 10×$1,20010 \\times \\$1,20010×$1,200 = $12,000/year
* **Combined** = $22,800/year from 100 subscribers.
* **Average** = $228/year per subscriber (i.e., $19/month).

In other words, the more Enterprise-tier accounts you land, the higher your blended average. If you anticipate predominantly Pro-tier individuals, your average will hover closer to $10/month.

# Putting It All Together

Let’s say in the long run you capture **10%** of the U.S. “Pro” market and **20%** of the U.S. “Enterprise” market. A possible scenario:

* **Pro Market** (260k–370k): 10% penetration → **26k–37k paying**
   * Each pays $120/year
   * **Annual revenue**: $3.12M–$4.44M
* **Enterprise Market** (5k–10k): 20% penetration → **1k–2k paying**
   * Each pays $1,200/year
   * **Annual revenue**: $1.2M–$2.4M

At the beginning of the company I signed an employment agreement that outlined my job title (CTO) and my yearly salary. I also have significant equity that vests over time. However, he states since I am a cofounder that I am technically a partner, and as long as he stops paying employment taxes and gives me my salary without anything withheld that I would then be considered a partner. I know there are nuances to the ""How much decision making power you have"" along with risk and what not, but are there any hard and fast identifiers that make you a partner instead of an employee?

Additional revenue sources may include advertising partners, collaborations perhaps with local cafes or bars. 

Other pop-up examples could include: bars, exclusive cover restaurants, yoga, outdoor cinemas, etc. 

The business could then develop to service brands looking to execute their own pop-ups.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d35a,1hwdo9c,Failures to avoid in your startup clothing brand and what to focus on,"Hey everyone, I have been working on growing my clothing brand for the last 2 years, and I know how tough it can be to stand out. I wanted to share a few things that can be related to most startups that I have learned so far. Hopefully this can help you make progress as well.

**Find your brand’s identity**: This is big time. For us it is to create a community through people who want to succeed in whatever area they are passionate about in their life. People that dare to step out of their comfort zone, something a ton of people can resonate with. Once you know what the brand identity is, creating a community will be easier. If you focus on that community, the rest will fall easier to its place. People love having something they can relate to.

**Work with reliable manufacturers** (!!!) : I put extra emphasis on this one because this is the part that I struggled the most with to begin with. My first manufacturers were unprofessional and the clothing was of poor quality. I was fortunate to find the professionals I needed, and having a good manufacturer makes your life a lot less stressful and just better in general. My advice is to be clear on what you want, ask your questions, and don’t settle for less. Great suppliers means better quality, fewer delays, less stress, good for business. If you happen to be in need of a solid clothing manufacturer, feel free to reach out. Would be happy to share my manufacturer with you, hopefully they can help you the same way they have helped me.

**Focus on helping your customers, don’t just sell to make money**: This is my favorite one. A lot of online business owners start a business because they want to make a ton of money, and they want to make that fast. The most successful business and clothing brands (in my opinion), are the ones that focus on helping their customers. If you are your own dream customer, helping your customers will be easy, because you know what you are looking for. What is your mission with your brand? Find ways to make sure that when a customer wears your clothing, they have that special feeling that you want them to have. You know this feeling, because you are your own dream customer (hopefully). Point is this, the more you focus on helping your customers and community, the more you will get back. The sales and the good word of mouth will come naturally.

Last thing, growing a brand is not something that is done overnight. My personal brand does really well through ads, and we have created an amazing email list. But over our socials we have tons of more work to do, but we are well on our way. Be prepared for the days you don’t want to, push through them, and the rewards will be limitless.

Hope this helps or motivates some of you! Feel free to reach out or comment if you have any questions!

These documents are mainly product documentation i.e. how to use the product as a guide, or it may be some other data that we need to process.

Is there space in the current market (or if no space a better product), which allows b2b document sharing with key features such as

* templating for similar documents to be sent to multiple clients
* versioning of documents
* integrations with emails to alert/summarise
* integrations with google docs/notion etc
* automated indexing etc so it's easily searchable

I am organizing myself in 2025 and I have a feeling that I should leave my startup and start something new. We are building a platform - which is always, very, very hard I suppose - and I am the tech guy. I am not good with selling things, which I needed a co founder for this project. But I have the feeling that he is not as commited as myself - and he has valid reasons for that, he has two kids and we both are still working in our main jobs right now. But I have build the whole platform and he was supposed to sell it (we got good feedback before building it), but he always has new ideas to change it (which would take a lot of hours) and he got negative feedback from one potential client and wants to change the whole product now. He takes so long to respond and he has no time to dive deeper in the sales part. 

So that makes me think: Should I invest more time into this? Without more speed we will not grow and another company is taking our clients and a platform without enough offers is just dead. I am very bad of the sales part and I am kind of shy (I am not shy in general, but with just calling potential clients etc.) - I think I have a fear of rejection (business and also when talking to girls I think). 

So I just want to doube check, what would you do? Should I leave it and start something new? Again, I understand why he has no time, but like that we will not have success and then we both can invest our time in other things.

I think a project with just one side would be a good start as well (B2C or just B2B, here we need businesses and users). The platform is solid and maybe I can reuse it in some way later. Also, do you have an idea how I can overcome this fear of rejection? I know that I need to overcome this anyway, because nobody is waiting for you in life.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d36d,1hvpbyi,"Your startup isn't special, it's a baby. And babies need support to survive. (The brutal truth about my journey)","Three weeks ago, I posted about my failed textbook app startup in r/Entrepreneur. Today, I'm running a successful consulting firm in Austin. The difference? It wasn't hustle culture or VC funding - it was having a support system.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about my success:

* I lived with my older brother for TWO YEARS, rent-free
* This simple support system, not ""grinding 24/7,"" was what allowed my business to survive
* My first startup failed because I tried to be Jeff Bezos. My second succeeded because I let it grow naturally

The Hard Truth I Learned:

Your startup is like a baby. It needs support to survive, can't feed itself, and definitely can't pay rent. Yet I constantly see posts about people wanting to quit their jobs to ""focus full-time."" Stop.

This isn't a movie. There's no montage where inspiring music plays while you go from zero to hero in three minutes.

What Actually Worked:

* Minimized expenses (thanks to my brother)
* Gave the business time to develop organically
* Kept my support system until the business could genuinely cover basic expenses
* Only scaled when ready (baby → toddler stage)

Through my consulting work, I've seen countless entrepreneurs make my initial mistake - trying to make their baby business run before crawling. This pattern was so consistent that I wrote ""Business as a Baby"" about it.

The Successful Ones Always Have Support:

* Living with family
* Maintaining their day job
* Using savings strategically
* Having a partner who covers expenses

Your startup needs YOUR support, not the other way around.

Yes, we all want to be that risk-it-all success story. But that's Hollywood thinking. Real success often comes from giving your business time to grow while maintaining a strong support system.

What's your support system? How are you planning to support your startup while it learns to walk?

Yes, let's be specific with the title - that's more direct and authentic:

EDIT: Wow - really cool seeing how many of you connected with the concept that a startup is like a baby. Your responses show how universal this experience is - we all need support systems and time to grow naturally.

I wrote a book called ""Business as a Baby"" about this framework (launching Jan 31st). For those interested in learning more, there's info in my bio.

You’d probably be surprised. That was an easy example, I’ll use a more sophisticated illustration next. 

Let’s say you run a music lesson business. You can’t reach out to other stores they’d never give you free teachers. You can’t reach out to college students they’re too busy with school and professors don’t entertain outside marketing. You can’t cold call listed music teachers because they already do it by themselves and cold calls are low roi. The irony behind this is that I know I’m wrong but I just can’t see it. I’m wrong because obviously people do create new music stores, barber shops or taco shops etc. I’ve never heard of a business failing because it couldn’t find staff per se or supply.

This is true of any business though, you could have a great business but if no one knows about it, you are done.

I’ve developed a strong passion for the tech industry, but not for coding itself—I’m more interested in strategy &amp; operations, product management, and early-stage investments (VC).

In the short term, my goal is to land a PM role in tech or a related position, such as Product Specialist, APM, S&amp;O, APMM, GTM or BA. However, I currently lack technical skills.

In the long term, I aspire to eventually build my own startup, potentially in FinTech, HealthTech, or SaaS.

How can I close the gap between being non-technical and gaining strong technical knowledge?

Here are the options I’m considering:

	1.	Pursue a Master’s in Data Analytics: This would help me learn SQL, Python, and other tools, while improving my technical skills through the program. I could also take courses in basic JavaScript, HTML, and React, as well as Harvard’s CS50 course.

	2.	Pursue a Degree in Software Engineering: This would provide deep technical knowledge, even though I don’t particularly enjoy coding (and don’t want to focus on it).

	3.	Pursue a Master’s in Management: While somewhat redundant with my BBA, a solid Master’s in Management has strong pipelines into tech companies (though often in sales or marketing roles). I could complement this with self-learning in Python, SQL, JavaScript, etc.

	4.	Pursue a Master’s in Financial Technology (FinTech): This would allow me to specialize in the FinTech industry.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d372,1hvk5nj,Why don’t more saas products use a minimum seat pricing model instead of per-user pricing?,"I saw a product that provides 2 or 4 seats based on the plan, and the price doesn't seem to change with additional seats.

This makes sense because it keeps pricing simple. Many SaaS tools charge per user, which works well for products like Slack or Notion where value grows with team size. But for tools like Canva or ChatGPT, a single account can be shared without losing functionality, making per-user pricing less relevant.

A **minimum seat model** feels more practical in those cases. It guarantees baseline revenue and avoids users gaming the system by sharing accounts. But why is it so rare?

I think it’s because **per-user pricing feels scalable** and familiar. It’s easy for companies to justify and optimize revenue as teams grow. A flat-rate model, on the other hand, might limit upsell potential unless users actively upgrade tiers.

Curious to hear what others think — is it time for more SaaS products to move away from strict per-user pricing?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d373,1hvif01,I've implemented a basic but fragile PoC for a very complicated AI app. But I think I need funding now to keep going. Should I raise?,"Hey guys.

I've been heads down coding non-stop for about 60 days now and I've build a really nice PoC of a AI app in the video space.

Seriously... I've been really burning the candle at both ends while trying to keep my sanity. :)

What I have so far is a:

- basic mobile app where the user can record videos written in expo

- basic webapp where the user can compose the video

- and then the super fancy AI thing that I can't really talk about.

The super fancy AI thing was a LOT of work and I think it's the first of its kind.  

The space is clearly headed in this direction but no one has released a product like this yet.

I've proven that what I want to do is possible but I think I need funding now to keep going.

- I need to optimize it to make it faster.  The task I'm working on now takes about 10 minutes to complete. It needs to be about 15-30s.  This is totally possible it's just engineering work.

- It's not 100% accurate. In order to get there, I have to tune it and build an eval system where I start building up training data then have human evaluators re-verify any changes in the output.

- I have to build or integrate a new AI workflow system to help with debugging the system because it's super complicated.

I think the market size is pretty huge and the opportunity here is really exciting.

I'm just worried that if I give investors access to the system they're going to shoot it down because it's not 100% accurate.

What I was thinking of doing is recording like 20 videos with it, then seeing what the accuracy looks like.  

So for example, if only 10 videos come out correctly then it's only 50% accurate.

I think I need to get to like 70% accurate.

In a nutshell, here are all the problems I'm facing:

- I have a really awesome PoC I'm proud of but it's not putting out all videos 100% perfectly.
- I'm a solo founder
- I'm not an obvious rockstar.  I sold my last startup in 2022 but it wasn't well known and I didn't work for a MAANG company.

A big percentage of AI products are just open AI wrappers, so it is low-quality, a very very low percentage provides a real value (one that can't be done with just ChatGPT and a good prompt). We found the one that works well is AI that learns all about someone´s business and gives really helpful insights, for example, AI that you integrate with your CRM, reads all the client's data, and then you can ask him anything or he can build documentation or general a kind of ""research"" about your business.

""Real"" AI products that are unique and provide a value that is hard to get from other places is really expensive. First, you need a lot of data (which costs a lot), train them (a lot of computing power and engineers), and then you have a model that has a unique value.

To make it short, we need more AI products, but the reality is that there is one ""type"" of AI product (chat GPT, Gemini...) and all the other products are just using it instead of creating their AI model. Same thing for image generators.

In general AI products that really work are ""co-pilots"", everyone is trying to build an AI that ""replaces"" the worker, ""use our AI and you will not work a day of your life"" kind of ad but from our research AI that really works are the ones that help the worker in their job, make it more productive by eliminating repetitive and boring tasks.

Example of AI that works well even as wrappers :  

\- AI that you integrate into an ERM understands all your business and then you can do whatever you want with it (chat with the AI to ask about anything, general reports...)

My thought was that universities specialize in pushing industries forward and that tool to get a student from idea to a market ready product that as a byproduct creates experience for volunteers, will be very interesting, however I didn't take into account that we exist in capitalism, everywhere in some or the other form. And for a startup it is important to be self sufficient, at least to an extent.

So if you are in EdTech, I think it works the same in other industries, the goal is to take a small tool and and do it so well that it will be more expensive for them not to have you on board.

So in conclusion, selling to universities with ideas/mockups is not longer an option as it was before, and their preference in terms of solutions is given towards more established companies.

This brings up a question, I don't really want to go to VC's, as it will make the company short term oriented and profit driven. Profit in this case is not a bad thing but not having the right balance can skew the incubation process towards an orgasm button (there was a research about implanting pleasure stimulating implants in mice) and in this case I might as well start a cartel.

How do I find a way of creating a sustainable startup without investments, given the profits would flow after about a 1000 founders will go trough the program given 100 of them will not fail. Or do I just give up and abandon my principles go to VC and milk every drop out of the founders?",startups,1736191252.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hv78jh/today_was_my_first_sales_meeting_for_an_edtech/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d386,1hv3fm7,"Need Advice: Crowdfunding, Government Grants, or Freelancers to Finalize My Startup","Hi Redditors,



I’ve been developing my startup, *Yaldo*, as a solo founder for quite some time. It’s a platform designed to help people organize and book unique, memorable group activities—think of it as the “Airbnb for experiences.” The idea is to empower both users and experience creators with an intuitive platform that simplifies the process.



**The Situation**



The platform is nearly finished, but I’m struggling to find the time to complete it. I’ve been doing almost everything myself, from design to development, and it’s been a long journey. Some of my former co-founders contributed early on but ultimately left the project due to misaligned goals.



Despite this, I’ve kept costs very low (I’ve only spent about €50 so far), as I’ve handled most tasks myself. However, I’m at a point where I need help to finalize the **admin platform**, which is key to attracting experience creators and ensuring the platform’s success.



**My Plan**



I’m exploring several options to move forward:

	1.	**Hiring a Freelancer:** I’m considering platforms like Fiverr or Upwork to find someone who can complete the admin platform based on my designs.

	2.	**Crowdfunding:** Launching a campaign to gather community support and raise funds to cover freelancer costs.

	3.	**Government Grants:** Investigating opportunities in Belgium for startup subsidies to help fund this final stretch.



**My Questions**

	1.	**Freelancers:** Is it worth hiring a freelancer for this critical phase of development? What’s the best way to ensure I hire someone reliable and aligned with my vision?

	2.	**Crowdfunding:** Is crowdfunding viable for a platform like mine, given that it’s almost ready but not generating revenue yet? How can I make the campaign appealing?

	3.	**Grants:** Has anyone had success applying for government grants in Belgium (or Europe) for a tech startup? Any specific programs I should explore?



**Additional Context**

	•	I’m not looking for huge investments right now; I just need enough support to complete the platform and launch it.

	•	The platform itself is functional, with most of the core features in place. The admin platform needs improvement to align with the design and provide a better experience for experience creators.

	•	I’m still committed to the vision of Yaldo and confident in its potential.



I’d really appreciate any advice, insights, or experiences you can share. This community has always been a great source of inspiration, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on how best to approach this situation.

I’m the founder of a 6 year-old self-funded supplement startup that’s currently bringing in about $4k/month in net profit from one SKU. I'm pivoting to address the untapped demand for personalized infant-nutrition supplements (and eventually formula).

I’m talking with a potential Co-founder COO/Integrator who has:

* CFO, COO, and CEO experience (has raised VC money)
* Been involved in a 3 exits (acquisitions/sales)
* A good track record in team leadership and operations
* A willingness to work 30 hrs/wk until we validate demand or secure funding
* A Wharton MBA

I’m trying to figure out a fair equity offer that:

1. Motivates him as a true co-founder without overshooting.
2. Leaves enough equity for me (the original founder) and an employee option pool.
3. Takes into account that he’ll need a salary **once** we raise capital or revenue climbs.

Right now, I’m leaning toward something like:

* **Me (Founder):** \~50–55%
* **Co-founder** **COO/Integrator:** \~20–30% (possibly \~26%)
* **Option Pool:** \~15–20% (for future hires/advisors)

Everything would vest over 3–4 years with a one-year cliff. We’re still pre-funding, so no one’s taking a salary yet (he’ll keep consulting on the side until we raise or have stronger revenue).

**Questions for you all:**

* Does \~26% for a Co-founder COO/Integrator at our stage feel too high, too low, or just right?
* Any advice on vesting schedules, or how to structure an option pool with these percentages?
* What do you wish you’d known about co-founder equity splits when you first set yours?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d38f,1hun8eb,What I've Learned While Building the First Human-Only Social Media Platform,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some lessons I’ve learned while working on an idea that’s been on my mind for a while: a social media platform exclusively for verified humans. No bots. No spam. Just real people.

The idea came from my frustration with how disconnected and impersonal social media can feel today. Between bots, fake accounts, and constant spam, it’s hard to know who you’re really interacting with online. I wanted to create something different. A space where every connection is meaningful and authentic.

Here’s what I’ve learned along the way that might help if you’re thinking about solving similar problems or building something community-focused:

1. **Start Small and Test Early**: I spent too much time early on trying to make things perfect. What’s worked better is focusing on the core value of the product (real human connections) and testing that idea with simple tools like surveys and waitlists. You don’t need to build everything upfront—validate the concept first.
2. **People Crave Authenticity Online**: One surprising insight was how much people value knowing the person they’re talking to is real. Building in trust and accountability (like one account per person for life) has resonated with almost everyone I’ve talked to. If you’re building something that involves user interaction, think about how you can increase authenticity.
3. **Simpler Is Better**: I’ve found that a lot of people are overwhelmed by complex features. Instead of trying to do everything, focus on the one or two things your platform does exceptionally well. For me, it’s the verification process and creating an environment free of bots and spam.
4. **Trust Is Everything**: If your product involves personal data or verification, people will need to trust you completely. Transparent communication about how data is used and stored is critical. This has been one of my biggest challenges, and it’s something I’m still figuring out.

Right now, I’m testing the idea and gathering feedback through a beta waitlist. If you’re curious about how this works, feel free to hit me up!

6799340e3474f2d0be95d393,1huhdc4,3 Costly Startup Mistakes I’ve Seen Firsthand (and How You Can Avoid Them),"Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work with several different startups, each facing unique challenges. Here’s what I learned from three of these startups and their biggest mistakes so you don’t have to repeat them.

*Note: I’ve kept specifics vague for confidentiality, but I hope these lessons are both fun to read and insightful.*

**Startup A: Absent CTO Complicating Early Growth**  
  
This was a classic startup chasing seed funding. They had an exciting concept, but the technical execution fell short, leading to low user engagement on their beta platform. Their CTO was surprisingly hands-off, raising serious red flags. We soon uncovered problem after problem, the most notable being that their internal API, which held sensitive customer data, was completely exposed to the public.  
  
The startup had outsourced their development, and their CTO wasn’t overseeing the work. This lack of oversight led to security vulnerabilities and a host of other issues that could have jeopardized their fundraising efforts if investors had discovered them.  
  
*Lesson:* A CTO or technical co-founder isn’t just a figurehead, they must stay actively engaged, especially when managing outsourced teams. If they’re not writing the code themselves, they need to ensure technical oversight and prioritize security from day one. Investors will eventually catch on if you don’t.

**Startup B: MVP Development Gone Overboard**  
  
This team was in love with their idea but took the term “minimum viable product” way too literally, except for the “minimum” part. Instead of focusing on their concept’s core functionality, they packed the MVP with unnecessary bells, whistles, and even a foghorn. The result? A delayed launch and wasted resources on irrelevant features.  
  
With limited funds, they prioritized feature development over launching quickly to gather user feedback. Instead of refining their product iteratively, they spent months making assumptions about what users might want.  
  
*Lesson:* When building an MVP, less is more. Focus on testing your core hypothesis with essential features, then iterate based on real-world feedback. Customers will tell you what they need. Don’t try to guess.

**Startup C: Bootstrapped Startup with Organizational Issues**  
  
This startup had bootstrapped its way forward with small, scrappy team. As they began to scale, the cracks began to show. There was no clear decision-making hierarchy, and team members were stretched thin, juggling too many roles. Even simple projects started to encounter delays and complications. On top of that, they lacked clear data on their customers, leaving them unprepared and unconvincing when engaging with investors.  
  
The scalability issues they faced and lack of key metrics made it tough to attract investors. Internal disorganization hindered their ability to execute effectively, let alone present a compelling growth story.  
  
*Lesson:* As your startup grows, it’s essential to define clear roles and responsibilities to avoid burnout and improve execution. Additionally, investing in data tracking and analysis early is crucial. A strong understanding of your metrics not only guides decision-making but also inspires confidence in investors.

**Final thoughts:**  
  
Obviously growing a startup will never be a perfect process. It demands agility, resourcefulness, and a lot of grit. When you come on board at later stages, it’s easier to spot problems because you have the benefit of a bird’s-eye view and an outsider’s perspective.

Despite the differences between these startups, one truth stood out: whether you’re in the early stages or scaling, success depends on nailing the fundamentals. Prioritization ensures you’re working on what matters most, organization keeps your operations running smoothly, and the right team members are the foundation of everything. Hopefully, these lessons help you build smarter, scale faster, and avoid costly mistakes along the way.",startups,1736111330.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1huhdc4/3_costly_startup_mistakes_ive_seen_firsthand_and/

We have seen companies like Honey, HelloFresh, NordVPN, and BetterHelp go all-in with influencer sponsorships, especially on YouTube. However, their outcomes seem mixed:

* **HelloFresh**: Marginal growth but losing customers.
* **NordVPN**: Performing well.
* **BetterHelp**: Struggling; their parent company, Teladoc, reported an $838M loss in Q2 2024.
* **Honey**: Data on their performance isn't widely available.

This makes me question whether influencer marketing is a reliable long-term strategy for brands.

As of now, I’m wondering that during the interview (aka market validation) phase, should I build a basic interactive prototype that allows pre signups?

What exists today?
The best competitor I found is AccessOwl, but it is a company founded in 2022, and I know there are lots of companies that still handle their SaaS access manually in a spreadsheet or similar.

How can I stand out from AcessOwl?
There are multiple things. First, I have been thinking about focusing more on companies that are not that technical. AccessOwl seems to be focusing on technical startups (for example you need to use Slack for it to work). Secondly, after trying out their application I find that they do not put that much focus on the organizational structure the customer sets up for their onboardings. My goal would be to have it as easy as adding an employee to their department+project would start the onboardingprocess for access automatically.

If you work for a company (&lt;100), how do you handle accesses to SaaS? And if you work for a non-technical, do you use enough services for a service like this to be worth paying for?

Some background, I've spent the last seven years developing advanced interactive visualization technologies. My work has in this field has been significant, including developing a live game for Disney TV and creating the technology that powers most online car configurators in India. I've also worked on making more efficient and cost-effective cloud rendering solutions that outperform most competitors in the market.

In 2024, I founded a US-based company with the goal of applying my cloud rendering technology to create virtual real estate tours. I had a partnership agreement where my partner was supposed to secure development resources and funding(They already had them but I never received it).This partnership recently dissolved. Despite this I, establish valuable industry connections.

Before this company, I operated either as a freelancer or through my proprietorship, successfully delivering these technological solutions.

Currently, I'm at a crossroads. Some of my recently established contacts are interested in investing in a new venture focusing purely on AI/ML product development. While this is an exciting opportunity, I also have potential buyers interested in my existing cloud technology for real estate applications. It would take me 2 months and some cost to push it out.

I'm exploring the possibility of building a business that serves both markets - continuing development of my cloud visualization technology while also expanding into AI/ML solutions. It might be a bad idea but I have been working on multiple projects my entire life so far.

I am trying to pitch myself as a business that does both and focuses on both and wanted to make some products and I require funding for that. Any suggestion on how I should pitch myself here?

TL:DR

Summary of My Key Points:

1. I have a concrete opportunity to establish an AI/ML company developing industry-specific products with investor backing
2. I have a near-market-ready product in my area of expertise with proven demand
3.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3a3,1htiz6w,The CTO Dilemma: The Real Problem Behind Finding Technical Cofounders,"After interviewing 30+ founders on YC's cofounder matching platform, I noticed something interesting: everyone's hunting for a ""CTO."" But they're looking for the wrong role.

Most accelerators and VCs require a technical cofounder on the founding team - it's often a non-negotiable requirement for funding. But here's the point: A CTO focuses on management, team building, and long-term tech strategy. At the early stage, what a startup actually needs is someone who can build an effective MVP - a creative full-stack developer who can move fast and validate ideas.

Breaking Down the Problem: The talented technical people you want are busy:

* Making great money at established companies
* Building their own projects as indie hackers
* Creating stuff they love in their spare time

These people aren't interested in:

* Vague promises about future equity
* Multi-year vesting cliffs
* Taking pay cuts for uncertain outcomes
* Corporate titles without real impact
* Getting stuck with early management tasks

What They Actually Want:

* Exciting technical challenges
* Freedom to innovate and experiment
* Quick build-test-learn cycles
* Projects that spark their creativity
* Equal partnership and recognition

👉 The Hidden Insight: The best technical cofounders are hackers at heart - they're more like artists than corporate. They love solving problems creatively and building things that work, even if it means breaking conventional rules. They can create effective MVPs with minimal resources and validate ideas quickly. Indeed, deploying a product is not just ""the product"" itself, it's a full set of technological tactical tools that will follow the startup evolution, like hacking SEO, scraping websites, using technology to scale fast, etc.

But here's the catch: most hackers don't dream about running big companies or managing teams. They're creators who want to build amazing things, not deal with corporate responsibilities.  
  
What Non-Technical Founders Try Instead:

* Freelance platforms: Pay by hour, often resulting in expensive, oversized products
* Agencies: High costs, not aligned with startup goals
* Junior developers: Lack the experience to build scalable MVPs
* No-code tools: Limited functionality for real validation

The Big Question: How can we create better ways for business founders to partner with these ""digital artists"" during the early days? ",startups,1736010548.0,220,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1htiz6w/the_cto_dilemma_the_real_problem_behind_finding/

* No salary for at least 6 months ""until revenue""

Virtually all research on startup failures points to cash flow issues as one of the top two reasons businesses don't make it. This isn't a matter of opinion—it's well-documented data. Just google the Statista reports called ""Main reasons for business failure among start-ups worldwide"". Every year they look the same: running out of cash and lack of market need are the two top reasons, and they account for approximately 70-80% of failures. These findings remain consistent year after year.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3ac,1ht1btt,What do you think about this idea?,"**Context**  
I work as a project leader in strategy and M&amp;A consulting, often on short engagements (3-5 weeks). At the end of these projects, we have ""retrospectives""—meetings that sound ""cool"" but rarely lead to meaningful outcomes. In a high-paced environment, impactful actions from these meetings are overlooked unless the team is heavily guided to prioritize them.

**Solution**  
I’m considering creating a retro platform tailored to these engagements. It would cater to project roles like Partner, Analyst, Project Lead, and focus on reviewing specific key moments (e.g., client meetings, final deliverables, general WLB balance, team spirit, etc.). Unlike other retro/post-mortem tools, it would fit this industry’s (or generally these types of industries') unique needs without forcing an irrelevant way of doing these retros.

**Potential MVP functionality that I've been thinking about**

* **Customizable questions**: Define reflection questions for each project
* **Participant roles &amp; invites**: Assign roles and send invites via email
* **Voting**: Prioritize key takeaways
* **Send to-dos**: Assign and email action items directly
* **Insights from retros**: Spot recurring themes (e.g., WLB issues, not enough client-facing time, etc.) across projects
* **Key takeaways summary**: Editable summaries for easy use in PPT slides
* **Anonymous input**: Enable more honest feedback
* **Pre-retro surveys**: Collect initial feedback prior to the meeting

**Why is it different relative to existing retro/post-mortem tools?**  
In my opinion, after looking for a solution to this in my daily life, I find that existing tools are overly Agile-focused, making them complex and irrelevant for consulting or finance. This solution would simplify retrospectives, tailor them to short-term, high-stakes projects, and emphasize actionable results.

I was recommended to two persons that are starting a business within fintech where I would be cofounder and responsible for tech. I have a masters and been working as a consultant for a decade in various clients, big and small. 

Their proposal is 10% for me and 45% for each them. They have been CEOs for a startup incubator and have a lot of experience in getting investments and building a company. They don't have a prototype or any customers yet but they have about 500.000€ in promised first round investments.

So basically everything is prepared to be done so it would be up to me to build it alone from the start as CTO and then with time the team would expand if everything works as expected.

Now the talks have been that due to investors and how it's unsure on what my role will be in the long run  (since vesting for everyone is 8 years) , 10% would be reasonable. 

My first thought was to have 33% each but maybe that's not very common in all scenarios especially like this when the investors are basically only doing it since they wanna invest in the two cofounders and trust them?

Thanks for all the replies, your contributions only confirmed my suspicions that it's a bad offer.

It connects users with professionals worldwide who offer virtual services—whether you're looking for a tutor, fitness instructor, chef, music teacher, nurse, or countless other services.

# How It Works:

* **Connect with verified professionals live.** The first 2 minutes are free to ensure authenticity.
* **Pay-as-you-go model.** Users are charged by the minute after the initial 2 minutes, with payments processed seamlessly via stored credit cards.
* **Rated profiles.** Service providers are reviewed and ranked, ensuring top-rated professionals appear first.
* **Free to download.** No barriers for new users, which led to 50K downloads in the first few months.

The app monetizes via small transaction fees and optional premium services. With global accessibility and 24/7 availability, it has unlimited growth potential.

# Why Relaunch?

* **Proven demand.** He achieved 50K downloads without extensive funding.
* **Scalable revenue.** A 1% active user base spending $20/month could generate $200K monthly—and the potential only grows with more users.
* **Promotional expertise.** We have a strong background in advertising and promotion, with a clear strategy to hit 1M downloads in the first year.

# The Challenge:

While the Android version is solid, iOS needs further development. My colleague has invested thousands of hours and significant funding into programming, but we need an **app** **developer partner** to help bring it back to life.

# What We're Looking For:

* A US-based, English fluent, skilled app developer interested in a sweat equity partnership.
* Someone who can handle programming while we manage promotion and financing the advertising campaign.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3b3,1hss5sn,Learnings and Reflection from 2024,"Hey guys,



Just wanted to have a discussion about experiences and reflections from 2024.



Just as a personal recap of the last year, I’ve experienced:

* Pivoting our startup out of the insurance industry which we had zero experience in.
* Being stuck in pivot hell and juggling between 3 different industries
* Finally, settling on an AI web scraping/data extraction company. 
* Finally making revenue on a startup.



Here’s a few things I’ve learned in the last year when it comes to pivoting and ideation:

1. Just do stuff, don't be afraid of action: A lot of times we're perfectionists and want to have the best idea or the best product before getting started. We get scared of just doing stuff, whether it's marketing, sales, or even engineering. As long as you're moving chess pieces forward you'll be constantly learning about what the user wants. Don't get stuck being stagnant.



1. Pick a problem you've faced: Ideally, pick a problem you’ve faced. This reduces a lot of the learnings that you’ll have to go through because you’ve already dealt with the problem. Not to mention, you’ll know and understand the user base.



1. Don’t build solely for yourself: When you’re solving your problem you get in the trap of building a solution for yourself. Just because you find it to be the perfect solution doesn’t mean the world agrees with that. Use user feedback to steer your startup and use your expertise to row the startup forward. 



Any learnings you guys had in 2024?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3b4,1hss1q1,"Sick of success stories? Here’s what really happens
","I’m tired of only hearing success stories—let’s talk about the real challenges founders face. Here’s ours:

I left my dream job in 2022 to bootstrap a gamified fantasy basketball platform. We hit €50k ARR and raised €725k by late 2023 to scale across Europe. But by mid-2024, the product wasn’t performing in new markets. We weren’t ready to scale.

After strategy sessions, we revamped the product with a new vision: creating engaging, playable sports experiences. In September 2024, we relaunched with a small budget and improved based on user feedback.

**Key insights since launch:**

• Retention is strong(we have D1 45%, D3 37% up to D14 23%), but monetization is weak.

• CPI exceeds LTV, and ROAS isn’t viable. We're testing constantly with premium features to increase ARPDAU.

• Resources are tight (€70k, mostly for salaries), making scaling tough. We can use around 1-2k€ marketing budget per month to run ads to validate if the product is good enough.

The pressure is mounting—both on the team and me personally, as a CEO with a baby at home. I nearly burned out in December.

**Our big questions:**

• Should we pivot to B2B (white-label for leagues/sportsbooks)?

• Can we validate B2C monetization before funds run out?

• Should we switch markets, sports, or start a new product?

Time is running out, and we need clarity. Strong B2C traction, a pivot to B2B, or a bold new direction—what’s the right move?

Any advice or perspective would mean the world.",startups,1735925903.0,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hss1q1/sick_of_success_stories_heres_what_really_happens/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d3b5,1hsnh1v,How my first indie hacking year went,"Well, a full year of unemployment turned out to be a full year of indie hacking at the end, and it was a blast. I completely enjoyed every single second of it, yet it’d be a complete lie to say that it wasn’t overwhelmingly depressing at times. If you haven’t been immensely successful, you probably already knew the feeling. Nevertheless, I am just here to share what I did and what I learned in 2024.

# Project #1 | Summ

For context: Summ is (or rather was) an AI-based email summarizer.

* Started working on it in January.
* Completed the “mvp” on June 26.
* Launched on July 30.
* ProductHunt launch on Sept 10.
* Zero users at the time.
* Posted my story with this product, Summ, here on Reddit, got \~350k views, and my first free users.
* Thanks to the feedback of the people of Reddit, I decided that the “product logic” was immensely flawed. I looked up for solutions, but considering that people were not showing enough interest for me to keep pursuing, I gave up on the project, and sunset it. It is inactive now.

# Project #2 | Blurs

For context: Blurs is a browser extension that blurs or filters sensitive information on any web page.

I wanted my next project to have a much shorter building time, after all, if I am going to fail, it is better to fail as early as possible. This time, I had a personal pain to solve: Hiding my personal information during sharing my screen on meetings. Even though I considered building a native app in the first place, I decided that a browser extension is much faster to develop, and easier.

* Started working on it around mid October.
* Launched on Nov 4.
* ProductHunt launch on Nov 7.
* Got featured, upvoted 215 times, daily #10. Was in ProductHunt’s daily newsletter — the coolest thing ever happened to me.
* Thanks to ProductHunt, I made my first sale as an indie hacker. This made me so f\*\*\*\*\*ng happy.
* Still active, and looking for more users.

# Project #3 | We Build For

For context: We Build For is a platform that connects software development freelancers with clients. It is my third project that I recently soft-launched, and still working on it.

* Started working on it around early December.
* Launched on Dec 23.
* Soon: Will spend time on marketing to gauge interest in the product. Haven’t seen much yet, and will probably test a few things before deciding whether to keep pursuing this one.

# What I learned in my first year of indie hacking

It has been around one year, more or less, that I decided to take this journey of building tools and apps solely myself. Barely took any days off, worked my a\*\* off +10 hours every day - including weekends, holidays, etc. -, and haven’t made even $100 so far. Especially considering I have been unemployed for more than one year now, this sucks. Kinda hard to explain the feeling, but if you ever have been in a similar situation, you know it.

So, some lessons I learned during this indie hacking journey of mine so far:

* If you don’t have much direct exposure (i.e., many followers) on social media, it will be hard or spammy to distribute your product. But, if you build different, interesting stuff, it will make people wonder, and they will check it. This is what worked well for Blurs.
* Try to build products that you can distribute. In fact, decide on a distribution strategy before writing a single line of code.
* Always validate your idea. Validation itself and methods come in different forms.
* Never start with a solution. Talk to people, understand their pain points, ask them: “such and such solution exists, would they use it?”
* If something is not absolutely necessary for the first iteration of your product, drop it. Do not spend time on any secondary feature, a “what if I get 1000 users tomorrow?” plan, etc. Absolute focus on only one thing at a time. If everything goes well, you can worry about that later.
* Spend at least twice as much time marketing as you do building. If people do not know your product exists, they will not become your users.
* It is also a virtue to know when to abandon a project. You can go step further and set up a solid goal like “Make $1,000 in three months”. If you don’t fulfill this goal by the deadline you set, talk to their users and audience, see if there is anything you can fix to change things.

Well, that’s all folks.

Thanks for your time reading this. This year was probably one of the worst I had so far, and I can only hope that it will get better in 2025.

Happy New Year, once again \^\_\^

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3b6,1hsn8y4,"I’ve got an exciting startup idea, but I’m torn—what’s the best next step?","Hey Reddit,  
I’ve recently come up with what I think is a killer idea for a startup. It’s something I believe has real potential to solve a problem a lot of people face. Now I’m at a crossroads and need your advice:

Should I:

1️⃣ Start by building a basic prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product), test it with a small audience, and then start looking for investors?

OR

2️⃣ Skip the building phase for now, focus on preparing a solid proposal and business plan, and start pitching the idea to investors to get funding upfront?

On one hand, I feel like having something tangible to show (like an MVP) could really help attract investors. But on the other hand, I’m wondering if starting with a strong proposal and networking right away might save time and give me more room to scale later.

What would you do in my shoes? Or do you have a completely different approach that worked for you? I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who’ve been down this road before.

Let’s discuss!

=======

**Update**

First of all, a huge THANK YOU to everyone who commented on my previous post. The responses were incredibly helpful, and I appreciate all the advice and perspectives you shared. Since many of you asked for more details, here’s where I’m at:

I currently work at a company where we face a specific recurring problem that wastes a lot of time. With my startup idea, I believe every employee could save at least an hour (or more) of work each day. I’ve also realized that my previous employer dealt with the same issue, so I’m confident that there’s a clear demand for this solution.

**Target Audience:**  
The focus is entirely on companies—helping them save time, improve efficiency, and reduce operational friction.

**Employer Feedback:**  
I’ve already discussed this with my current employer, and they’re open to the idea. They mentioned that if they see a functional prototype or MVP, there’s potential for a cooperation, which is super exciting.

Now, I’d love to tap into your expertise again:

# What are the step-by-step actions I should take to get this startup off the ground?

I have a clear problem to solve and a potential first customer (my current employer), but I want to make sure I approach this systematically and efficiently.

Thank you all again for your support—it’s been incredible so far! Looking forward to learning more from your experiences.

I’ve built an OSS that’s gaining traction and will be the core of a new fintech/Doc Intelligence startup. I’m the main dev (EU-based, Portuguese), and I have a co-founder who’s a FAANG lead dev (US-based)—but he’s mostly hands-off at this point, will start once everything is set up.

I told the other founder we really need a B2B sales co-founder. I’ve tried everything, but I keep running into three types of candidates:

\- The kid out of college wants to be a wanna be entrepreneur

\- The EU resident without EU nationality, with a terrible Resume

\- The Top of the crop, 40/50 year old, making 200/300k+ in Sales in a FAANG/Top company, that would love to join but in a later stage, kids college don't pay by themselves.

I'm in the YC matching program but doesn't seem to yield results too.

I’ve been through two VC-backed startups this year (one before creating this project, and one potential merge), and I refuse to proceed without a solid sales partner. I’m tired of half-baked business models and zero sales expertise.

Has anyone else struggled this hard to find a real B2B sales co-founder? How long did it take you? Should I start attending in-person events in Europe or join an incubator to meet the right person? Any advice or experiences would be really helpful. Thanks!

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3bc,1hshuys,Slides for AI,"I found a pitch deck from the American startup Decagon in Business Insider.

The first slide, also the title slide: we are an AI agent for customer support. The investor is both intrigued (AI, agent) and disappointed (they’ve already seen plenty of AI customer support agents).

The second slide: growth charts. The numbers were blurred in the public version, but the lines had a nice upward slope. The investor’s disappointment might have started to fade.

The third slide: client logos. Webflow, Rippling, and Substack—everyone knows these names, and they don’t work with amateurs.

The fourth slide: why we’re winning. Honestly, the arguments are mediocre. ""Chatbots suck, agents rule,"" ""we win because we understand business logic better than others."" ""We win because we win"" would have been even more accurate.

The fifth slide: why we’ll keep winning. We’re awesome, and we have deep integration—our clients can’t quit us.

The sixth slide: vision of the future. Zero people in customer support, a great user experience.

The seventh slide: the team. Both founders are science olympiad champions (one is Chinese, the other Indian, yes). Both have already sold startups before. So, they’re smart and successful—hard to pass up.

The eighth and ninth slides: testimonials and blurred client results from the third slide.

The tenth slide: thanks, everyone is dismissed. Not even a contact.

Judging by its brevity, the deck seems like it was designed for a live meeting rather than for sending by email. Commentary was clearly needed to understand it. Either way, the slides worked: Decagon raised $35 million this summer using them. In the fall, they had another round—this time for $65 million—and it’s unlikely the materials changed much by then.

Hello everyone i have seen that this community is golden and i thought why not try my luck for my blocking thought

I am building an online food order app, where i provide only the online ordering through apps. One is for users, who use app to order food and one for restaurants kitchen display orders, one other for the delivery guy.

I come from eastern Europe country so food is relatively cheap, good Burgers cost max 2.5 euros and most of good restaurants have their own delivery cars and guys. So i wanna bridge this gap. 

The problem is pricing should i charge the user per order and also restaurants a small fee per order. I am very pesimistic that restaurants agree to pay me 0.20-0.30euro per order even though i know this app would definitely help them and ease everything

Another way is that if i make it FULLY FREE i will definitely get much more users that use it. So maybe later i can benefit from it. or seek investment

I am a developer so my only investment is time and hosting approx 50euros per month

Without it, even the best marketing strategies or significant funding won’t take you far... it’s like building a house on shaky ground.

In my experience, by selling a product that truly fits your market; it all comes down to deeply understanding your audience. That means talking to customers, getting honest feedback, and being able to adjust as you go. Sometimes the product you thought would work perfectly ends up needing major adjustments based on what the market actually wants. Never lose your mission for your business, there is a fine difference between changing everything, and adjusting for the better. The mission carries your business, that is how you are in business. If you can help your customers more by adjusting your product (by staying within your mission), I would say go for it.

When I launched my first venture, I spent too much time perfecting the product without getting any feedback. It wasn’t until I started actively listening to feedback and iterating that I started seeing real traction.

My biggest lessons for new/aspiring founders:

1. Progress over perfection: Don't obsess over getting everything right. Launching imperfectly beats waiting for perfection (that never comes) EVERY SINGLE TIME, if you're ready to pivot or iterate based on user feedback 🤌

2. Talk to users ASAP: The moment your MVP is ready - or close to getting ready - start talking to potential users and gather feedback on the product. Real insights come from real users, not assumptions.

3. Ideas evolve: Your first idea might not work, and that's absolutely ok. Every attempt at taking the product to users will refine your understanding of real problems, required solutions and what you can do for the same. And so even if your initial idea doesn't succeed, if you keep on going and iterating/pivoting, that same idea will lead you the idea that wil eventually succeed

Seeking Expert Insights on Smart glasses,AR glasses,Spatial computing devices.

I’m exploring opportunities in the wearable technology sector, particularly focusing on smart glasses, AI assistants, and AR glasses.With big players like Apple, Meta, and Google leading innovation in this space, there’s a growing interest in wearable tech.As someone considering a product in this space, I’d like to gain insights from professionals, entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts to understand the current landscape and future potential.

Here are a few key questions I’m grappling with:

1. Market Viability:
Is the wearable tech market, especially smart glasses and AR glasses, still open to innovation, or has it become too competitive and saturated for new entrants?


2. Growth Trajectory:
How do you envision the growth of this sector in the next 5–10 years? Could this be comparable to the rise of smartwatches in the early 2010s?


3. Unmet Needs:
Are there specific pain points or gaps in this space that remain unaddressed and could present opportunities for a unique solution?


4. Consumer Readiness:
In your opinion, are Indian consumers ready for advanced wearable tech like AR glasses, or is mass adoption still a few years away?


5.Tecnical Advancements:
Should I consider and get inspired by the existing products or build from scratch?


I’m keen on building something innovative, but I’m also mindful of the need to differentiate and address real-world problems. Any advice, market insights, or thoughts on trends would be greatly appreciated.

Happy New Year everyone. I hope 2025 is good to you. 

I am starting a Sales Agency and I wanted to post here on a weekly basis to share my progress, get some ideas and keep me honest. I have sales experience in financial services, telecoms and insurance but I know the field can humble you if you don’t get abreast of current trends and methodologies. I may have some experience but this is the first time I am venturing out on my own and thus, it’s a bit unnerving. 

Here’s what I have done thus far:

- Spent the last 3 months reading, researching and watching a ton of Youtube videos and hearing from current players
- Decided on a niche on which to focus
- Registered my company 
- Registered domain name and created a website with social media pages
- soft tested an Upwork resource who will help me with email marketing and cold calling. He worked on a 2nd business of mine from October to December but he didn’t know he was inadvertently auditioning for the role of 1st hire for my agency. I have informed him today and he is raring to go
- Working on my strategy, call scripts, communication templates, proposals, demos and agreement/invoicing templates. 
- Onboarding my CRM (using the cheapest version of Hubspot which has a dialler….for now)
- prepping for January 6th when we will officially commence outreach. 

This is where i’m at now and I am under no illusion this will be easy. I do know that the challenges ahead will be matched by the strength of our will. Sales has always been a numbers game and we plan to play it. Slow, steady, long-term. 

I will post again on Friday to let you know where we’re at.

Need to share a recent experience and get your thoughts on next steps.

**Quick Background:** Started in game dev, built it into enterprise tech. Created visualization platforms for automotive companies, then expanded into AR/VR/XR solutions. Recently moved into AI/ML space with 8 successful enterprise projects.

**The Mess Up:** Was developing new AI/ML products when what seemed like a perfect deal came through:

* One company offering development resources and sales
* Another bringing investment

Long story short:

* Wasted 8 months
* Middle company blocked direct investor communication
* They used our demos to copy solutions
* Started calling us their subsidiary without permission
* All while I was dealing with a concussion (great timing, right?)

Finally met the investors directly - turned out they'd been trying to fund us all along, but middle company kept blocking.

**Key Lessons:**

1. Always maintain direct communication
2. Meet partners in person
3. Know your market value
4. Document everything

**Current Status:**

* Documenting all IP
* Creating proper company structure
* Evaluating market position

**Questions:**

1. How do you properly vet potential partners?
2. Technical founders: how do you protect IP while demonstrating capabilities?
3. Thoughts on bootstrapping vs raising at this stage?
4. Resources for structuring enterprise tech companies?

What problems would you want YOUR AI Co-founder to solve?","A few days ago, I shared my entrepreneurial journey and the endless loop of startup struggles I was facing. The response from the community was overwhelming, and it validated something I had stumbled upon while trying to solve my own problems.

In just a matter of days, we've built out the core modules I initially used for myself, deep market research capabilities, automated outreach systems, and competitor analysis. It's surreal to see something born out of personal frustration turning into a tool that others might actually find valuable.

But here's where it gets interesting (and where I need your help). While we're actively onboarding users for our alpha test, I can't shake the feeling that we're just scratching the surface. We've built what helped me, but what would help YOU?

When you're lying awake at 3 AM, stressed about your startup, what tasks do you wish you could delegate to an AI co-founder who actually understands context and can take meaningful action?

Of course, it's not a replacement for an actual AI cofounder, but using our prior entrepreneurial experience and conversations with other folks, we understand that OUTREACH and SALES might actually be a big problem statement we can go deeper on as it naturally helps with the following:

* Idea Validation - Testing your assumptions with real customers before building
* Pricing strategy - Understanding what the market is willing to pay
* Product strategy - Getting feedback on features and roadmap
* Actually revenue - Converting conversations into real paying customers

I'm not asking you to imagine some sci-fi scenario, we've already built modules that can:

* Generate comprehensive 20+ page market analysis reports with actionable insights
* Handle customer outreach
* Monitor competitors and target accounts, tracking changes in their strategy
* Take supervised actions based on the insights gathered (Manual effort is required currently)

But what else should it do? What would make you trust an AI co-founder with parts of your business? Or do you think this whole concept is fundamentally flawed?

I'm committed to building this the right way, not just another AI tool or an LLM Wrapper, but an agentic system that can understand your unique challenges and work towards overcoming them. Whether you think this is revolutionary or ridiculous, I want to hear your honest thoughts.

But more importantly, I want to hear your unfiltered feedback in the comments. What would make this truly valuable for YOU?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3e4,1hr7ai4,Cofounder randomly deciding to go part time when he was supposed to commit,"To set some context, me and my cofounder started a company in June 2024. I was responsible for the technical development and he handles the business part of it. We each own roughly the same stake. I was working on the idea full time and he was working part time since he was still working. He dropped his resignation letter in sept but work demanded him to work for another 3 months due to an employment clause before he was relieved - This was all fine with me since this was communicated to me before hand. 

I built the MVP out in about 5 weeks but sales was lagging - the product exists but no one knows about it. 

His last day of work was in the last week of December and I was really excited to give it our all for the company's growth. 

Today he drops the bomb shell that he is going to continue working part time on the company because he got selected into a fellowship at a top tier venue. He claims he needs 6 more months before he fully commits to the company. 

I don't like this, I honestly feel cheated at this point. I have waited 6 months for this (and worked on this for more than 8 months unpaid/unemployed) only for him to say he needs 6 more. When I enquired when he applied to this fellowship, he says it was after we incorporated the company and applied thinking it was a part time role (where you spend few hours a week) but the role which was offered to him now is a full time one.

However I can’t think of true advantages except the following:
1. Extreme high skill in something very technical - however this often means you’re very niche 
2. High network of friends and family and connections who will pick up your phone - and this means you don’t need VC money

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3e7,1hr386t,How to actually achieve your goals in 2025,"Hello everyone,

I'd like to do a quick post about how we can drastically improve the chances of achieving our goals in 2025 with these 5 stupid simple tricks/tips/whatever you want to call it.

First of all, this is basically all advice from a certain video from Ali Abdaal on Youbute but you may not be familiar with his content so thats why I'm sharing this here.

Hope you enjoy.

Before we begin there is one thing you have to know.

**The difference between people that achieve their goals vs. the ones that don't is the action they put in.**

I'm sorry to break it to you, but if you don't put in the necessary action no matter what I write below is going to help you. Not even God himself can't help you.

Now, that we have established that the most important thing you have to do is simply put in the work, we can continue with the rest of this post.

5 things you can do TODAY to improve your chances of achieving your goals in no particular order are:

**1. WRITE THEM DOWN**  
\- ""do you have a list of goals?"", ""can you show them to me if I ask you?""  
\- research shows that people who write down their goals are 42% more likely to achieve them  
\- simply, just write them down on a piece of paper, on your computer, whatever

**2. LOOK AT THEM**  
\- when you write them down, you have to look at them  
\- why? because there is a part of your brain called RAS (reticular activating system) that is in charge of what you pay attention to --&gt; the more you look at your goals the more you will pay attention to them and to what you are doing  
\- once a week, month, day, ... doesn't matter, just look at them often

**3. MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS**  
\- ask yourself: ""what are my quests and how are they doing?""  
\- then change what needs to be changed according to the answer (if you're doing great just keep going)  
\- treat it like a loading bar in a video game (at the end thats what life is, a game)

**4. PRACTICE ""MENTAL CONTRASTING""**  
\- this research was done by a psychologist Gabirele Oettingen  
\- visualize your goals and how you will achieve them  
\- the ""catch"": don't just visualize achieving your goals, but also visualize the obstacles on the way and create a plan of how you will overcome them

**5. TIE THEM TO AN IDENTITY**  
\- ask yourself: ""what does the person that achieves all these goals look like?"", ""what action does he/she take on a daily basis?""  
\- label yourself as someone you want to be even before you become that person  
\- here is the thing; if you label yourself as a procrastinator, you will continue to be a procrastinator... just do the opposite... be delusional with the choices you make and how you act

That's pretty much it. I hope it's clear.

May 2025 bring you a lot of love, peace, health and success.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3ea,1hqnzmv,Just read the YC Guide to Co-Founder matching - seems like I made all mistakes in the world,"Long story short - I've got a consultancy business that I've been working on since 2021, slowly getting attention and trying to scale up. So far, everything happened organically, and I've invested zero dollars in growth. But I'm like really bad at sales. I once sold a brand new 500 quid bike for 25, to give you an illustration.

Thought it would be a good idea to find someone experienced, and share a big chunk of the company, to get things going. I filled out the form on Y Combinator, and then I read through the guide they published

The guide tells you:

* Better find another technical founder than a business/sales founder or learn how to sell it by yourself - I'm kinda ready to support that person in every way to make the business work, but what's the point doing sales yourself if it's not working?

* Do not expect someone to come and take ownership of things that you cannot do - isn't it the whole purpose of finding a partner? 

* Don't lock yourself into an idea - at this point, it's a business that some people in the industry are aware of. Is it really that bad to look for someone who can dive in?

* If all of the above is true, you're probably looking for an employee rather than a co-founder - the money I make from it is barely enough to cover my own living. Are there employees that are ready to work for free (including splitting any potential revenue 50/50)?

▪️Build in public: Sharing progress, setbacks, and learnings attracts valuable feedback and connections.

▪️User feedback is gold: Talk to users early and often. It’s the only way to build what people actually want.

▪️Collaborate wisely: The “who” matters more than the “what.” A strong cofounder/team makes all the difference.

▪️You don’t need a unique product: A product doesn’t have to be unique and new to succeed. Don't stop building just because something smiliar exists. In fact, it means there’s demand. Focus on your unique angle; it can be better execution, improved user experience, or solving pain points competitors missed.

▪️Stay persistent: Its going to be tough, but worth it. Consistency wins.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d3ec,1hqxi8b,Only 4% of companies ever earn $1M ARR ,"Let's look at the stats and be honest with ourselves. 

There are no VC sugar daddies and sugar mamas coming to save us.

So we need to starting rely on ourselves, if we want to make it to the other side.

There is a proverb that says something like, ""if you want to go fast you go by yourself. If you want to go far, you better bring company.""

It's time to prove to ourselves that we are who we say we are.

In 2025, we're going to need to put our adult clothes on, stop asking for handouts, and start supporting one another to build our own.

It's time to decide if we founders around the world want to become a community of startup founders that speak truth to power; who hold one another accountable for measurable results in real-time, and who prove that finding product-market fit doesn't take genuis or a bank vault of money.

Or do we want to keep perpetuating the current cycle that hasn't worked?

It's time to show this world a new breed of startup founders who say less and do more; who take care of one another, who spend less time on delivering products, and who spend more time on delivering results.

I know this Reddit group has enough solid people in it to birth a new generation of founders who can cut the bullshit, come together in earnest, and produce startups in 2025 that break the statistics, by breaking the $1M ARR mark; to prove to the world that lean startup principles are effective, repeatable, and teachable.

And to end the practice of pandering for investors when we haven't done the boots-on-the-ground work it takes to identify and solve real-world problems BEFORE we start asking for funding.

I know we are capable. I know we are worthy. I know we exist.

When you're focused on a product, and you launch, you want to be the first.  This way you have a bigger splash and more people talk about you.

However, in reality I'm sure there are situations where two products hit the market and pretty much do the same thing.

I guess what you do in this situation is just really focus on the customer and try to carve out a niche?

Like they do high end, low volume, and you do the reverse? Or you would focus on a certain demographic or user type?

About 6 weeks ago, I met Don who's now my *business strategy partner*.

We meet every week for an hour (more time and more times if needed).  I tell him about my business.  He tells me about his business.  I tell him what I know.  He tells me what he knows.

But Don and I have separate businesses.  I don't own any part of his business.  He doesn't own any part of my businesses.  We don't share code (unless it's open source).  We are not partners in the general partnership sense or the cofounder sense.  We are just sort of part of a two-person mastermind group.

We fit. I'm the ""doer"" who doesn't know much but I learn by running out and screwing up and I push Don to ""do"". Don's the ""knower"" who has studied everything so he tells me the best stuff to know.

In the end, Don gets me aimed in a better direction.  In the end, I get Don moving at a lively pace in the pretty good direction that he's already aimed at.  We're sounding boards for each other which is huge since we're both solo founders.

I met Don in a paid course.  I paid $197 and Don paid for an extra upgrade so he paid $1,197.  (That was a great signal.)  The course isn't even about business; it's about writing books.  We quickly realized that we are doing startups and other similar businesses, too.

For me, paid courses are a great people filter.

1. When I met Don, I knew that, at least, he had a few $100s because he bought the course.  I don't waste time on wannapreneurs who have $0 to spend on their startup, either due to poverty or being cheap.  If you only have $0 to invest in yourself, you're not worth my time.
2. When I met Don, I knew that he was serious about his own business.  If people risk their money to pay for a course, they are saying, **""I'm serious enough about this subject that I'm willing to risk my money to do this.""**  When people show up on free social media, they are saying, ""I have nothing better to do with my time.""

Don is reliable af.  We've got the next 4 weeks planned to discuss 2025 for him, then 2025 for me, and I know that he'll be there.  Don is solid.  He's proved it.

So, you don't have to settle for some flake or crook as a cofounder who you met on social media and will screw you and your startup over in 6 months.

1. understand customer feedback to improve your business. Analyzes online review with context and explains it with a drill down, aggregation, charts (AI insights, timeframe reports); evidence driven, agentic LLM and ETL processes drive this.
2. respond to customer feedback, half-automated, human in the loop, but AI supported. In the tone of your brand, any language. And context-aware, with your customer support signature etc. 
3. competitor analysis. Because we do 1 for you, we can do 1. for all of your competitors and compare the results, yielding insights like „oh, this happens to everyone in November to December, so I should focus on something else“ — etc.

Now, after a huge sales effort we got only one paying customer. This customer is petty happy with the product. They tell us that they use our product daily, it‘s better than all the other solutions out there (better than TrustYou, etc.)

However, after cold calling/emailing hundreds of leads, we almost always hear that „what we have is good enough“. Or that they don‘t have budget. 

I‘m the introverted tech part of the startup. I‘m good with algorithms. Give me any tech issue and I will solve it for you quickly and efficiently. I make stuff work. But with my startups I never had commercial luck. People always tell me about my stellar potential, because I can build things almost nobody else can. I come from a poor families background, worked my way up the very hard way. I just love tech and programming. I wrote a book for O’Reilly once. I‘m not doing bad economically, but I‘m probably not the best sales person. After founding a few startups with amazing tech, people using the products and loving them, but no commercial success, I truly question myself and if I‘m just unlucky with the fact that I‘m located in Europe, targeting the wrong industries, or are just unlucky somehow? I won‘t blame my co-founders here. They definitely did the best they could. I‘m just a bit resignated. I recently thought about valuing my own lifetime more and only building software for myself anymore. Basically not focusing on what problems other people face and trying to solve them, but solely focusing on what I enjoy doing most — e.g. coding algorithms for a music visualizer. Because in the end, my time is my most valuable resource. If I waste any second on something that isn‘t contributing to „my life“ and how I define success, then it would be a rather stupid deed?

I could use some advice. I have a family member I really care about and trust a lot. I’ve been giving them tasks to help with one of my business ventures because I want them to eventually take over so I can focus on another.

But here’s the thing: they don’t seem to have that fire in their belly. Sometimes it feels more like I’m managing an employee than working with someone who’s truly invested. They say they want it, but tasks often get left hanging, and there’s just not that same level of hustle I was hoping for.

So, I’m starting to wonder—can you actually turn someone into an entrepreneur if they don’t have that drive from the start? Have any of you been in a similar situation? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any experiences you might have had.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d40e,1hpw9sz,how i was looking for startup ideas wrong,"Hello everyone,

I recently came to a major conclusion regarding coming up with ideas for startups. A common philosophy taught is to look for problems in your life and then try to solve them. (Bonus points if you experience the exact problem) What I have come to realize is that most of the good problems aren't going to have anything to do with the business/startup niche. Of course there will be some problems in this niche, but I would dare to say that many of the problems of the startup niche have been solved in some ways (although there is always room to make the solutions better). This is because out of all of the niches in the world, the startup/business niche has the most problem solvers, so it would make sense that the first place all these problem solvers look to for problems is the startup/business niche. I mean just look at all the useless tools for founders/business owners because people don't think to look elsewhere.

What am I getting at with all this? I think that you are likely to find the most problems in the areas you spend the most time in, whether this be a specific video game, your work, a small online community for keyboard lovers. I've fallen into the trap of spending a lot of time in the startup/business niche, so inherently most of my ideas have come from there, but I've realized that the startup niche is not the best place to look for the hidden gems aka really irritating problems. I encourage you, reader, when trying to find business ideas, to follow your genuine curiosity into areas that HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH BUSINESS. The corners of the internet is where most of the unsolved problems are.

I’m working on a new app idea called LinkUp, and I’d love to get your feedback on it. The concept is simple: it’s an app where you can quickly connect with new people nearby for a one-time meetup (not a dating app). You don’t need to send messages, and there’s no chatting within the app – just a fast way to meet someone new.

Here’s how it works:
	1.	Sign in and immediately see an option to “Meet Someone New.”
	2.	If both of you are open to meeting, you’ll be matched and asked to confirm.
	3.	The app automatically suggests a location that is equally convenient for both users (within a selected radius).
	4.	You meet, chat, and see where things go from there – no strings attached.

The app is designed for people who want to meet new, like-minded individuals in their area – whether it’s for a casual chat, sharing ideas, or just expanding your social circle. It’s all about meeting up and seeing where things go, with no pressure or expectations.

I’m still in the early stages and would love some feedback before proceeding further. Does this sound like something you would use? What are your thoughts on the concept?

I’m doing some research to help founders avoid the signs and traps. 

I’d like to be clear and acknowledge that the term “narcissist” gets thrown around a lot. There’s a difference between the full blown personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. That many have. Some would argue you have to be a bit of a narcissist to be successful in business. 

I’m talking about traits like insecurity, control, inability or refusal to experience shame. A grandiose sense of self that leads to overt or covert dysfunction and destructive behaviors. Professional love bombing or emotional injury and manipulation. 

I once worked for a family office run by a grade A narcissist that, after years of therapy, I believe has full in NPD. Almost cost me my marriage. 

I’ve also had cofounders with narcissistic traits that have been emotionally abusive and sabotaged success. I was susceptible for a long time until I got the help I needed. 

So, I table this topic not to vent or tear anybody down. These days I have compassion for founders that show these traits but can’t see their own self-sabotage. As an advisor I meet them every week. 

I’m curious as to how pervasive this problem is and what discussions would be productive. Startups are hard enough without cofounder dynamics.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d41a,1hpnhfi,How to validate your idea step-by-step without overthinking it,"I've seen a lot of people in the community (myself included) struggle with figuring out *how* to validate their ideas effectively while avoiding analysis paralysis caused by conflicting advice (e.g., ""Start with a landing page,"" ""Talk to people,"" ""Build an MVP YESTERDAY..."").   
  
After doing research and piecing together actionable steps, I've created a simple outline to sequence idea validation for bootstrapped SaaS projects (or honestly, any kind of startup).

This is especially helpful if you're trying to figure out the **right order** for approaching things like collecting feedback, determining demand, and building your MVP.   
  
Here’s the breakdown:

# Step-by-Step Sequence for Effective Idea Validation

# 1. Research What Others Are Asking

* Start by collecting **12+ threads or posts** (e.g., from Reddit, Twitter, forums, etc.) where people are discussing problems closely related to your idea.
   * Pro Tip: Focus on threads where users are genuinely frustrated or asking questions because that’s gold for identifying pain points. Specific details are important.
   * Take note of specific words/phrases they use to describe their problems — this will be key for messaging later.

# 2. Build a Simple Landing Page and Mockup

* Use the insights from the threads to craft a **waitlist landing page**. Address the pain points you discovered and explain **how your idea solves those issues**.
   * If your product has a visual component, include a **simple mockup using Figma or interactive screen recording** showcasing the core functionality. If it's a mockup, annotations will be helpful to guide the readers eye.
   * Keep copy short and focused on the core value prop. Borrow phrasing directly from user complaints/questions for authenticity. You've to make them feel like you've read their mind.

# 3. Start a Content Engine (Blog + Helpful Replies)

* While building the landing page, create a blog (I use Ghost) and write **answers to the exact questions you found earlier** in your research threads.
   * For example: If people were asking ""How do I determine the willingness to pay for SaaS?"" write an actionable blog post offering strategies and share it freely.
* **Be helpful, not pushy** — your content should solve *their problem* first and foremost.

# 4. Track New Conversations

* Use tools like **F5 Bot** (for Reddit) or keyword alerts on Twitter/Google to monitor when people bring up similar questions or problems again.
* When you find new conversations, **add real value in the comments** — include actionable advice based on your blog content and link back to the post only if it makes sense. Remember, adding real value means you can alleviate their pain. So be specific.

# 5. Build a Waitlist and Drive Traffic

* Leverage the traction you get from answering questions in comments and from social media to grow interest in your waitlist.
* Bonus: If you have a small marketing budget, use **targeted ads (fb or Reddit)** with the same research-backed copy to further boost sign-ups. Start with a $100 budget.

# 6. Use the Waitlist Feedback to Build Your MVP

* Depending on your sign-ups and engagement, you’ll have:
   * Real feedback on what messaging resonates most with your audience.
   * Validation of whether there’s a solid level of interest in your solution.
* Build an MVP focused **only on the core feature(s)** people care about most (the stuff discussed in the threads).

# 7. Sequence Your Launch &amp; Build Hype

* Use your waitlist to create momentum for the launch. Share progress updates, showcase snippets of the MVP, and explicitly tie the product’s features to the **pain points from your initial research**.
* Any new value blog posts that you write, send them that too. This continues building trust.
* Example: If users in your initial research asked, “How do I collaborate better with designers on landing pages?”, your product should answer that directly with its functionality or resources.

# Revenue Calculations (Optional)

* Based on feedback I’ve seen and personal experience:
   * Aim for **20% of your waitlist sign-ups** to convert to paying customers.
   * Backwards plan: If your launch revenue target is $5,000 monthly and the product costs $50/month, you’ll need \~100 paying subscribers (so aim for \~500 sign-ups with a 20% conversion rate). Although, I'd consider anywhere between 25–50 subscribers enough to confidently start developing an MVP.

# Why This Sequence Works

1. **It starts with what customers actually want (not what you think they want)**
   * You’re validating whether there’s *real demand* by engaging with people who already have the problem.
2. **It minimizes upfront risk.**
   * Instead of spending months building a product no one wants, you test the idea through a landing page and waitlist traction.
3. **It builds your audience first.**
   * By engaging early and offering value (e.g., blog posts), you nurture potential users while still testing the waters.
   * At the end of the day, you'll have to launch at some point. And you'd rather have people ready to open their wallets or scratch and claw to find your first users. This way is better.

# Closing Thoughts

I know it can feel overwhelming when you’re starting out with idea validation. But following a structured sequence like this can help you stay focused, reduce wasted time, and get to **real validation** sooner.

What are your thoughts?

**TL;DR**  
Success in idea validation hinges on understanding your users’ problems first. Start with research, validate with a waitlist landing page, and build content to foster engagement. Use that momentum to build your MVP and strategically launch while keeping the users’ initial pain points front and center.",startups,1735566205.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpnhfi/how_to_validate_your_idea_stepbystep_without/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d41c,1hplo0j,Non Technical Cofounder does no work.,"My friend and I decided to create a startup a few months ago. I was supposed to be the technical cofounder and he was supposed to be the non technical cofounder. He has 2 other pretty successful businesses but these businesses are in a completely different industry than tech. They are more centered around direct to consumer products rather than a B2B Saas tool that we are trying to create. Before we really got into it he told me that he didn’t have much time on top of his other businesses but since we would be equal partners(he also chipped in some money) he would do what needed to be done.

 It has been a few months now and it feels like his entire work style just doesn’t work in a tech startup. He insists on contracting almost all work that he has been tasked with which normally would be fine but really drags out the process. I’ll usually ask him what he’s been working on during  week and there will be no results except for monitoring the work the contractors are doing. I’ve told him pretty directly to work on some things like a pitch deck and some documentation which I don’t interpret as a crazy amount of work and he just won’t do it. 

At this point I’m a little bit lost. I understand the importance of non technical cofounders however a lot of the things I ask him to do and he isn’t able to do are things that I feel like I could do in 20-30 minutes instead of it being dragged out. I understand how swamped he is with his other businesses but it feels like this new one is just not a priority to him and I’m curious how things are going to be after launch where I feel the non technical role only becomes more demanding. I’ve expressed these concerns to him and his response was he like to take the laziest approach possible and make his money work for him which isn’t invalid there are many business men who think like that but I feel all of this goes against what I know about tech startups being scrappy quick and as cheap as possible. 

I’m wondering how to proceed with this situation. There’s a part of me that believes every member of a founding team should be have some ability to be able to implement and take action but he seems to believe that it is okay for him to play a high level management role even though it is just the two of us and a contractor and all of this is just resulting in more work for me.",startups,1735559657.0,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hplo0j/non_technical_cofounder_does_no_work/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d41e,1hpjfnj,Startup Infrastructure,"First let's establish the tech stack:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node / Express / Supabase ( auth + db )
* Domain: Registered in Cloudflare

Second why this post:

While I know I could just throwing my projects into AWS without much consideration I would prefer to take an approach that meets these three criteria:  


**Simple:**

While I could spend the next 1-4 weeks diving into how dev ops should be done and how to securely deploy my services in a way that won't bankrupt me if I make a mistake i'd prefer to focus on developing the product knowing that I can sleep at night without incurring a $5000 AWS bill for compute resources. 

Also simple in the sense that I wouldn't need to use too much of my time maintaining containers or updating things to keep it running.

**Safe:**

I'd like to know that I haven't misconfigured something in AWS in such a way that I can potentially cause some security vulnerability or allow bad actors to take our services down.

**Scalable:** 

I'd also like that to an extent I could easily scale the frontend / backend to meet the needs of the business up until the point it is required to either hire or contract someone who actually knows how to build out these systems to be cost effective / scalable. Ideally it would be automated.  
  
Now to the point:

I humbly accept that while with my current knowledge I could absolutely throw the projects into services in AWS and have them running just by hacking away at. While looking online on forums like Reddit I was looking at the managed services offered by AWS ( Amplify, Lightsail, Fargate, Cloudfront ect) and it seemed like a good fit where you can essentially pay slightly more but have AWS spin up all the services under the hood which complies with some kind of proven blueprint whereby you can focus more on the actual product and worry less about the infra.

I seem to see a lot of contradicting posts on Reddit about these services suggesting to stay away and just simply ""throw it in an ec2 instance"" due to scalability or cost related issues.

While I would love to dive into devops and really learn the ins and outs I've ended up in a tailspin of analysis paralysis in choosing the right solution to deploy version 1 to our customers and honestly on top of a 9-5 it's a bit much to not only then continue to develop / maintain the project but also to really understand / deep dive into devops.

  
Would extremely appreciate suggestions / resources that would help me make some decisions deploying these services  given the above criteria.",startups,1735550207.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hpjfnj/startup_infrastructure/

💡 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐩 : At the start of the year, I was running an agency. Life was comfortable, but I wanted more. I had an idea for Vizio - a tool to help content teams/Video Editors/Creators . It was just a scribble in my notebook back then. For the first time, I decided to take the leap and turn that scribble into something real.

⚙️ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 : We built the first version of Vizio with many features we thought people needed. But it was too complex - users struggled and didn’t even try. We trimmed it down to solve one clear problem, and it clicked.

🤝 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐭 : This year, my technical cofounder left, and everything came to a standstill. As a non-technical founder, I felt lost. After weeks of searching, I found someone great on YC’s cofounder-matching platform, and we started rebuilding together.

🎉 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 : I’ll never forget the day our first customer used Vizio. It was a small step, but it felt like a giant leap. Since then, we’ve grown to 100+ happy customers. Each one makes me believe in this dream even more.

📚 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐮𝐫𝐞 : This year, I almost failed a semester in college. I wasn’t upset about it. I was proud - because while my grades were slipping, I was creating something that people were actually using and finding valuable.

😞 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐍𝐨 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐬 : There was a month when everything felt stuck. We were showing up daily, giving it our all, but no new customers came in. Those days tested us. But they also taught us patience and persistence.

💪 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐅𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 : Through all the ups and downs, what makes me proudest is my team. We’ve faced rejection, failures, and tough decisions together. Yet, we’re still here, excited and ready to build something amazing.

As we step into 2025, I’m more excited than ever to keep building Vizio - to help content teams simplify content production.

A lot of this stuff is pretty simple stuff, but it still can be very powerful.

**My 2024 Business Lessons**

* When you come up with an idea, you must actually test if people have that problem. This will save a ton of wasted time on product ideas that nobody actually wants. **(The Lean Startup)**
* Use a build-measure-learn feedback loop figuring out what the customer doesn’t like and make iterations as quickly as possible. Work in small batches to achieve faster iterations. **(The Lean Startup)**
* The right people are much more important than the right ideas. Ideas come from people therefore people are more important. I cannot stress enough how important great people are to a business. **(Creativity, Inc.)**
* To make a great product, the makers must pivot from creating a product for themselves to for others. **(Creativity, Inc.)**
* To be original you must do a lot of volume/work. “Quantity is the most predictable path to quality.” **(Originals)**
* Never worry about giving away too much free value to customers. **(Building a Storybrand)** &lt;-(lots of great copywriting tips)
* The more lives you positively impact, the more wealth you’ll attract. **(The Millionaire Fastlane)**
* Great customer service is imperative because customers are great forms of advertising via word of mouth. **(The Millionaire Fastlane)**
* The easiest way to make a great product is to make something you want to use. **(Rework)**
* Ideas are treated like gold, but the real gold is good execution. **(The Millionaire Fastlane &amp; Rework)**
* Launch your product as fast as possible! If you had to launch in 2 weeks, what would you cut out? **(Rework)**
* Instead of out spending or out selling competitors, out teach them **(Rework)**
* The most important customer service tip is speed; get back to them fast! **(Rework)**
* Dive deep into the ideal customer. Really try to understand them. **(Build)**
* Deadlines force you to get shit done! They inspire creativity. **(Build)**
* The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins. Great ideas eliminate actual problems, not fulfill lightly desired wants. **(Build)**
* “What you’re building never matters as much as who you are building it with.” Once again stresses the importance of people. **(Build)**
* Make an incredible product for 1 audience not a so-so one for a bunch of different audiences. (Find a niche) **(The Mom Test)**
* If the audience doesn’t care enough to be actively trying to solve the problem, they probably won’t care about the solution. **(The Mom Test)**
* Product First, Marketing Second, Sales Third **(The Trillion Dollar Coach)**
* Become active in the community/niche involved with your potential product. Look for problems within the community to solve. Build strong connections in the community by contributing. **(The Minimalist Entrepreneur)**
* Before marketing/sales, really try to get your first 100 customers through family, friends, and the product’s community/niche. **(The Minimalist Entrepreneur)**
* Try to create a niche to avoid competition. If not, try to iterate until the product idea is completely original. **(Expert Secrets)**
* Encourage dreams, justify failure, allay fears, confirm suspicions, and throw rocks at enemy (marketing from the customer's point of view) **(Expert Secrets)**
* List out all the false/limiting beliefs that a potential customer might have that would make them not want to buy the product and try to debunk them. Eliminate purchasing risk. **(Expert Secrets)**
* Great reviews/refers go a long way; give discounts for them. **(Expert Secrets)**
* If you have a very good product, do collabs/promotions with influencers in the specific niche. **(Expert Secrets)**
* “The amateur is a weekend warrior; the professional is there 7 days a week.” Be a professional. **(The War of Art)**
* Use permissionless leverage to your advantage like media **(The Almanack of Naval Ravikant)**
* Become a creator who provides value in your product’s niche. **(Most of the books I read)**
* Don’t learn then start; start then learn. You must start as soon as possible. **(Most of the books I read)**

But my struggle with this is unless you have a strong product / marketing / pr person on your team you could assume people don't like the product, but it's actually a great product and the issue is marketing or messaging.

For example, maybe I'm using the wrong channel / medium and it's just not my audience. Maybe the product is great for my target audience, but the messaging doesn't properly explain what we do or why they should use us.

Self-funded, so we don't have unlimited funds to run tests, but we've worked with a few consultants that have helped, but most of our learnings have been trial and error.

My bigger question is, how have founders - especially technical founders who like me aren't particularly skilled in GTM - evaluated product / market fit?

And what are realistic KPI's? Is it free trial signups? Website traffic? Paid customers? Email clicks? All of it.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d427,1hp5oul,"Code, Chaos, and Finding Truth: A Journey to Digital Wasteland","Two months ago, I sat in my room staring at my resignation letter, knowing I was about to throw away a perfectly good backend developer career. Why? Because I finally understood something that would change everything: most of what we're taught about building tech products is beautiful, polished garbage – the kind that keeps you up at 3 AM, your mind screaming that something's fundamentally wrong.

**The Breaking Point**

You know that moment when you realize you've been living someone else's dream? There I was, surrounded by browser tabs full of entrepreneurship courses, market research guides, and growth hacking strategies. My desk looked like a shrine to startup culture – sticky notes with ""MVP"" and ""SCALE"" plastered everywhere. Man, I even had one of those ""HUSTLE"" posters. What a joke. Every night, I'd lie in bed with this sick feeling in my gut, my thoughts racing: ""This isn't us, man. We can't do this bs. It's not who we are.”

Here's what they want you to believe (and what kept me tossing and turning):

* You pick a profitable niche (that bores you to tears)
* You research your ""target audience"" (people you'd never want to have coffee with)
* You ""provide value"" (whatever that means)
* You ""scale"" (while your soul slowly dies)
* You ""succeed"" (but can't look at yourself in the mirror)

Each time I tried to follow these ""proven strategies,"" it felt like swallowing poison. My subconscious would revolt at night.

**The Moment Everything Changed**

One day, I just snapped. Threw all that conventional wisdom out the window. Because here's the truth: I don't want to build for people with fat wallets. I want to build for the misfits, the artists, the code poets. My people – the ones who live for software, electronic music, art, and design. Then came the real questions. When I stopped trying to be what I'm not, these started haunting me:

* What if the process matters more than the end goal?
* What if authenticity isn't just a buzzword?
* What if building something true is better than building something profitable?
* What if our daily frustrations are actually pointing to what we should create?

**Finding My Own Madness**

Then I stumbled upon Greg Isenberg's idea that everything we do is a product. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I stopped looking outward and started looking inward, into the chaos of my own mind. Because maybe, just maybe, the answers weren't in some mentor's PDF guide but in the things that kept me up at night.

**The Daily Grind's Hidden Gems**

Now I question everything I touch in my daily life. Every app that annoys me, every workflow that feels wrong, every tool that doesn't quite fit. These aren't just irritations – they're breadcrumbs leading to something real.

**What's Actually Working**

Here's what I've learned from my time in the wilderness:

* Trust your gut when something feels off
* Build for people you actually give a damn about
* Make the process as important as the product
* Let authenticity guide you before money
* Question the mundane – it's hiding gold

**The Road Ahead**

6799340e3474f2d0be95d434,1hoqyjx,"Seeking Advice on Scaling Our Startup: Marketing, Cloud Costs, and Attracting Foreign Investors","**Hello Everyone,**

I am seeking advice and survival tips for my startup.

**A Little Flashback**

Back in 2021, my team lead and five colleagues from my previous company decided to pursue an idea for a startup. The main plan was from our team lead. The plan was for the team lead to secure clients and funding while also contributing as a developer. Meanwhile, the rest of the team would learn coding and start developing our product. We accepted that as we all were in IT support and had eager to learn coding.

In 2022, I transitioned into a DevOps role with moderate expertise in Django and helped build a product. One of my colleagues became a C# developer. However, by late 2022, everyone except me and the team lead left the startup. Currently, the team lead owns 80% of the company, while I hold 20%.

By mid-2024, we successfully developed four stable products. We sold the Django-based app to multiple businesses, including two high-profile companies that are actively using it.

**The Issues**

We now have nine employees, excluding me and the CEO. Starting in early 2025, we expect to generate approximately $4,000 per month in service sales. However, we are facing several challenges:

1. **Marketing:** We have not spent any money on marketing, which limits our growth potential.
2. **Expenses:** The $4,000 revenue will primarily go toward employee salaries, cloud bills (AWS), and office costs.
3. **Cloud Costs:** A significant portion of our expenses is related to AWS. I looked into AWS credits for startups, specifically the Activate Portfolio program, but I am unsure about the process. My goal is to maximize the credits we can obtain to alleviate cloud expenses.

**Seeking Advice**

* How can we secure angel investors from abroad? We are looking for investors who understand the potential of IT and can offer reasonable funding terms. Unfortunately, investors in Bangladesh often undervalue the sector and demand high equity in exchange for small amounts of funding, which could harm the company’s growth.
* Any tips for building a stronger portfolio to attract international investors?
* Suggestions on cost-effective marketing strategies to expand our reach would also be very helpful.

**Projections**

By the end of 2025, with proper marketing, we believe we can attract more large companies both in Bangladesh and internationally.

Your suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d43a,1hocdje,Stuck and unmotivated ,"You read it..... I am stuck and unmotivated. In March, I signed a lease to open my shop. I was on top of the world, after 2 years of planning with a S.C.O.R.E. mentor, I received a grant for my main machine, I had all my equipment, my suppliers, my location, and had an open date for 4/1/24. Our open date was planned to coincide with a large semi annual even across the street from our shop. Everything was finally coming together. One moment I was flying high, and the next, the ground was gone. 

  
Literally everything seemed to fall apart, all at once— 

Our location included 2 buildings. Building A was the main shop with seating. Building B was going to be used as an office/storage - future use will be for take out/drive thru. 

Less than a month after I signed the lease (paying deposit + 3 months rent), I wanted to give myself a a couple month cushion. We got huge amount of rain, and both buildings flooded. The flooding went on until end of May early June. Now we are 2 months past our open date. We live in a small rural area, local businesses rely of annual events for good revenue. Then next event was going to be July 4th. 

June 19th - My nephew (2M), that had been with our family for the last 18 months (long story), was picked up and taken by his biological mom, despite her absence, lack of communication, and against advice of our local sheriff's office. Legally I was stuck - my brother has no intention on being a father or making sure my nephew is safe. When this happened, I remember trying to file guardianship papers, the court clerk wouldn't file them for me, talked social services, begged her to do it gradually so he can get to know her. I don't really remember much of anything between then and mid- September. It hurts me to say that now because my fiancé and our 3 kids (12F,14F,15M) feel the pain and loss just as much as I do. (As an update, bio mom keeps saying we can plan visits, etc, but always finds a way to not show up.)  It's been 192 days.  - Ok back to business. 

July 4th - had no business even trying but we did anyway, we were going to open come hell or high water.....  instead it was ended up being electricity giving us the shock. building A wasn't fully ready so we utilized building Bs large open front area - until not a single electrical outlet worked in that room (there was around 10). Determined to salvage this disaster we move all our coffee pots, warmer, supplies into the empty future ""office area"" very small about 6 outlets but they at least worked! Until they didn't. Between breakers, confusion, and mayor AND BUILDING OWNER trying to talk to me in the midst of this mess I'm pretty sure I checked out and told everyone to shut everything off and go home. 

August - I reach out to the building owner because I know I haven't paid July or August rent yet. At first he seemed fine, and willing to work with me, than he started becoming very persistent about me paying him, I was getting multiple texts daily asking for the money (knowing I still hadn't opened, and with all the BS with the buildings). September I told him I did not want to continue with the lease, he made me feel very uncomfortable, not only emotionally but physically (he would literally look into the shop windows while i was working) instead of coming inside the unlocked front door of his building. It gave me the creeps. Also our county has zero building or health codes ( I know, WTF). 

Now it's almost 2025, my machine I got with the grant, was taken back (because) opening was one of the stipulations), so when they found out I wasn't going to open, they came and took the machine. All my other equipment, supplies, furnishings, inventory are stored in my garage at home.  

I've spent the last 6 months just trying to keep going, trying to manage, the business blocks, muddle through the grief, help hold our family somewhat together though all this, that I lost myself and my goals. Which is ironic bc I usually have about 3 plans, for each decade, for the next 5 decades constantly running through my head. Some days I feel like we are finally getting our groove back and will be able to move forward, than some days, I still spontaneously cry for hours because I pickup up one of my nephews toys or outfits. 

I have no clue what I am even trying to get out of writing this.  I am so grateful for having great kids, the best sister, a safe home. 

I can handle my shit. Always have. I will find a way through it.  Nobody tells you how lonely grief is, or just can't explain it.  ",startups,1735411951.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hocdje/stuck_and_unmotivated/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d43b,1hoawm0,What do you think of SaaS 2.0: Service-as-a-Software?,"A new term has recently emerged in the business world:  
**Service-as-a-Software** a.k.a. **SaaS 2.0**

In general, some authors of articles promoting this term assume that the new and rapidly growing possibilities offered by AI and automation mean that problems that were previously too individual or support-intensive can now be tackled. The focus is on (human) service on the customer side and the background processes in the company are fully AI-supported and automated. Unlike traditional SaaS, no software is primarily offered here as self-use.

In other words:  
**""Service as a Software"" (SaaS 2.0)** is a new type of business model that mixes software automation with real human support. Unlike traditional SaaS, which provides self-service tools for users to solve problems on their own, SaaS 2.0 focuses on delivering results by combining technology with human expertise.

In this model, software handles repetitive tasks like data processing, scheduling, or matching, while humans step in to provide guidance, handle exceptions, or solve complex issues. This approach is often called **Human-in-the-Loop** because humans are actively involved in key parts of the process, ensuring a personalized and empathetic experience for the customer.

SaaS 2.0 is especially useful in industries like healthcare, education, or elderly care placement, where trust and personalization are critical. For example, a traditional SaaS might offer a tool to search for care homes, while a SaaS 2.0 solution would also provide a care consultant to help families make the best choice. In this case no traditional marketplace is needed where the supply and demand side used to be scaled simultaneously. Instead, an AI can now search for the best match for a place in a retirement home and a human in the loop can be the external face for the customer and the retirement homes and thus act as an agent.

By automating routine tasks and using humans for high-value touchpoints, SaaS 2.0 delivers better outcomes, builds stronger relationships with customers, and stands out from traditional software that relies only on automation.

I love the journey I’ve embarked on, and look forward to every moment I get to build the future I hope to see. I’m currently in an accelerator program in SF for the first time ever, and I’m really trying to pick up momentum. Realistically, I don’t think I’m going to get picked by the VC for funding for a number of reasons: I’m solo-ish (my cofounders are not here in sf or full time), I’m not building ai/crypto/vr, I don’t have crazy high revenue, I don’t have crazy high users, and, to top it off, it’s a social app (ik, tough lol)

Before I got here, I was fairly proud of my mvp having amassed sustainable growth and revenue at the local university. However, this accelerator program quickly hit me with imposter syndrome as I wasn’t doing nearly enough of what VCs are looking for. I’m confident in what I’m building, my craftsmanship, the demand, and the business model to monetize.

I’m torn between making use of my limited, bootstrapped resources towards hyper focusing on user experience, small/large scale revenue growth with customer sales, user growth, fundraising, or hiring a team. I know the answer is usually all of the above, but I need help deciding on what to prioritize on. 

I know it’s obviously very nuanced and depends on a lot of factors, but any advice or help would be greatly appreciated! I would love to give more context if anyone requests :)",startups,1735384840.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ho3r5w/what_do_i_prioritize/

I’ve been doing SaaS startups for years and have seen many things. This one is a mind bender. My BIL and I’s relationship has rapidly deteriorated over the last year as I’ve built the product to be self-service, low-maintenance and low-cost to run.

I believe he now sees me as dispensable and hence wants to get me out of the company. I own 50% shares outright of the company and there are no repurchase terms.

My BIL has been gaslighting me on small things and the drama and magnitude of deception has grown to the point where I decided to resign from my operational role. He’s muddied the family relationships and has attempted to blackmail me to sign a mysterious offer to buyback my shares at peanut value.

I still have read-only access to the books and I’ve seen the sales projections for year-end are off the charts. He’s kicked me out of all other company comms which I understand makes rational sense if I no longer work there, but he’s behaving very erratically. Going off current ARR multiples, looks like the current valuation would be around $5m.

Given I never took out a salary, and BIL cannot be trusted (he owns other 50%, we are fully bootstrapped no outside capital raised), what do I do to liquidate my shares ? I want out even if it means taking a discount and covering closing costs. It’s an EU climate health company and I believe it would make most sense to offer my position to a PE firm with existing EU portfolio companies.

I’ve started to look into options for listing on online marketplaces to find a buyer to fully buy me out, but I have never done this part of the startup journey of selling under duress.

Currently looking for a job in an insane job market as an IC, got the young kids, my wife and I on Medicaid but still need to figure out income to survive while I resolve the startup exit.

Any insights from those who may have walked this path would be appreciated, I’m desperately all ears as the financial strain and family isolation dynamics are not long-term positions i can withstand.",startups,1735369996.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ho0go8/dicey_exit/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d446,1ho09w4,Suspicious TikTok Ad Conversions – Anyone Experienced This?,"I recently ran an experimental ad campaign on TikTok, using Branch io to track events like installations.

After running the campaign for a day, TikTok reported 110 conversions at $0.70 per conversion, which sounded too good to be true. I double-checked in Branch, and it was indeed showing 100+ INSTALL events.

However, I noticed **0 signups**.

I’m also running smaller ads on Instagram, which are converting well. This makes the 100+ installations with 0 signups from TikTok suspicious—there’s no bug or red flag in our sign-in flow, as we’ve already had 1,000+ signups through other channels.

As far as I know, the only way Branch can log these INSTALL events is through the SDK configured inside the app. This makes it seem like someone or something is genuinely installing the app in bulk and then discarding it.

Has anyone experienced something like this before?

We are 3 founders with equal shares and equal legal rights in our startup (a Delaware C corp). Recently, we've had some issues with one of our co-founders who has stopped performing and we also discovered he lied about some agreements we made within the founding team at the time of incorporation.

Long story short, he wants to leave, and we also want him to leave. However, it's become contentious as the departing co-founder has threatened to screw us up. We incorporated just six months ago, so his shares are unvested (which he is unaware of, as he doesn't really pay attention to legal details). He has demanded half of the investment we've received so far to buy back his shares, even though he is not entitled to it.

We know we can call a board meeting to remove him, but we are almost certain he will not sign the share repurchase agreement, even though our company has the contractual right to repurchase all his unvested shares at nominal value. If he refuses to sign, what are our options other than litigation?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d44b,1hnpd8b,Startup Christmas - Pain Point Giveaway ,"To celebrate the holidays in a startup fashion, I thought it would be fun to giveaway the most coveted startup currency for aspiring founders: pain points. 

I will start it off, and feel free to DM me if you have ideas that can *directly* and *clearly* solve them.

Coding:
1. Code like me - The most frustrating part of a lot of AI tools I use, like Cursor, is that it’s good at generating code, but that code often doesn’t feel like, work like, or structure itself like my code. Something that would fix this would be great, but only if it really works and feels frictionless.
2. Create the tests for my code I didn’t know I needed - A lot of AI tools can spit out tests no problem. The problem is if I’m going to the work to think up these tests, that’s half the brainpower. Something that can not only generate tests for me but really think through the tests I need would be something I’d actually want.
 
Cold Outbound:
1. I’m personally a believer in personalization: I don’t want to sound like an AI just reading their job title or a basic LinkedIn scrape. Something that could make an online dossier of info about them I could use could be useful if it’s done right. Why? Doing this research wastes time

Assistant:
1. AI Web Automator Like Loom AI. I see so many tools that claim to automate web workflows with AI, and they all seem like a pain in the ass to use or don’t work. If I had something as simple as loom where I could be doing some repetitive task online, give it a show of my task, and let it rip through the rest, that would be great. How to make this work and feel nice? No idea, but I’d buy if you did. Why? These types of tasks are often one-off, annoy me, and waste time

Communication:
1. My team and I often communicate on Slack about random issues, updates, and info. Something that could organize this so I can easily look back on any topic like a timeline, that would be huge. The kicker? I don’t want to have to search by specific topic, because half the problem is I don’t remember them all. The other kicker? I don’t want a huge directory of topics, because I’ll never be able to find what I’m looking for. Maybe the solution is to have some sort of automatic organization, timeline organization, or automated categorization. To be honest, I don’t know, but if you could make it easy to look back on specific topics, know what’s talked about, and make it manageable to read, I’d be in. Why? It’s a mess to track topics, sort through what’s going on, and stuff gets lost.",startups,1735334690.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hnpd8b/startup_christmas_pain_point_giveaway/

I imagined a token launch platform where people could follow the launched projects, tokens could become friends with each other, and even get married and have children. The idea captivated me so much that, despite my limited blockchain knowledge, I thought I could handle the entire project on my own. I even had a slogan ready: The social media platform for tokens.

I spent the first three months writing contracts, then the next three months learning frontend and backend development. By the end of six months, I had a working prototype. I was amazed—did I really pull this off?

I immediately uploaded it to a server, set up the necessary social media accounts, and after a few posts, I waited.

But no one came… not a single soul. A couple of social media influencers didn’t help either—turns out they were just manipulating their follower counts with fake accounts. Later, I found out that for $200 on Twitter, even Britney Spears will follow you…

That’s when I realized marketing is just as important as the project itself. But I had neither the network nor the funds to do proper marketing. I thought I could raise money by launching a token for the project, but messages to several token launch sites and dozens of VCs didn’t get me anywhere either.

I recently registered a company for my business in the produce industry, but I just found out that the name I chose is already trademarked. My plan was to import fruits from Peru and have them packed in boxes with my own private label branding.

Since I can’t legally use the company name for branding, I’m wondering:
	•	Can I create a new private brand that isn’t trademarked and use that on the packaging?
	•	Is it okay to include a note on the packaging saying the brand is “owned by” my company, even though the company name is trademarked by someone else?

I’m asking because if I were to change my company name, it would be a huge hassle—informing all my vendors and customers, updating all my licensing, and changing my bank accounts.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d46d,1hmoi5e,Red Flags When Choosing Business Cofounders - A Tech Founder's perspective ,"After 15 years building startups as a technical founder, here are the critical red flags I've encountered that every technical founder should watch for:

🚩 1. **Disconnected from Their Target Market**
- They're trying to solve problems for people they don't know or understand
- No existing network or connections in their target industry
- Can't demonstrate deep understanding of customer pain points

🚩 2. **Treating You as ""Just the Tech Guy""**
- Not valuing your strategic input beyond coding
- Dismissing your vision and ideas for the business
- Poor collaboration and one-sided decision making

🚩 3. **Equity Red Flags**
- Offering low equity while expecting you to build the core product
- Unwilling to discuss fair equity splits
- Only fair if they already have paying customers or significant traction

🚩 4. **Waiting for the Perfect Product**
- Not doing any marketing or sales until the product is ""ready""
- Using product development as an excuse to delay customer engagement
- Lack of parallel progress in business development

🚩 5. **Financial Behavior Issues**
- Unclear about sharing costs and revenues
- Delayed payments or reimbursements
- Lack of transparency around money matters

🚩 6. **Blaming Product for Lack of Growth**
- Always saying ""we can't grow because the product needs X feature""
- Not talking to customers or gathering feedback
- Refusing to iterate based on real market needs

🚩 7. **Self-Centered Leadership**
- Never asking about your perspective or wellbeing
- Only focused on their own vision and needs
- Poor team communication and collaboration

The Bottom Line: A strong founding team needs mutual respect, shared vision, and complementary actions. Your co-founders should be actively building the business while you're building the product.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d46e,1hmoenj,Does finding a cofounder here actually work?,"I see regular posts here of founders looking for a cofounder. It’s a common request I get as an advisor and in our communities. So, I get it. 

I’m curious of any success stories? It seems like a long shot to me. But then again, there might be tons of networking that occurs with more than I’m acknowledging. 

If there was a success, what was the main factor?

I know many founders that have tried YC’s solution without success. But there must be a reason it still exists. 

Getting a right cofounder takes time. Treating it like a shotgun wedding is a recipe for disaster more often than not. I’ve seen many startups shut down or never get lift off so many times this way. There’s a reason many investors dig into the foundation of how cofounders met and how they’ve worked together through the rough times. 

But I could be wrong and there’s a way to meet cofounders here I’m not seeing. It would help a lot of founders I know.

6799340e3474f2d0be95d46f,1hmns9o,We built a tool to help you find relevant grants. Would you pay for it? ,"Hi everyone,  
  
About a year ago, I asked you guys whether it would make sense to develop a tool to help entrepreneurs find relevant grants. Many of you provided incredibly valuable feedback, which we used to refine the concept. With this concept, we went through Techstars and finally launched a beta version of our grant scan tool last week!

Along the way, we realized something interesting: when you ask a grant advisor which grants might be a great fit for you, they almost always recommend the ones they know well. This makes sense since most work on a success fee basis, and referring you to lesser-known grants (which take more time to write and have lower success rates) isn’t worth it for them. Plus, memorizing the details of 20,000+ grants is, understandably, pretty tough. 

Our platform uses AI to scan and analyze thousands of grants. It identifies the best matches, estimates your chances of success, and calculates how much time you might need for the application and reporting phases. We can then match you with a grant advisor with relevant expertise—whether to write the application for you or provide feedback on your draft.

We’re considering launching both a free and a paid version. The free version would provide basic insights, while the paid version would include more comprehensive results, expert comments (such as explaining why certain grants are a good fit), and updates when new relevant grants become available. Both versions will allow you to connect with relevant experts.

Would you pay for the paid version? And if so, which features should it include?

Also, any general feedback is much appreciated!

I’m in the process/thought of starting a SaaS company , and I’m stuck on a decision I could really use some perspective on.

Here’s the situation: I’ve got a solid background in backend development / Cloud and experience in leadership/sales, but when it comes to frontend dev, I’m at a beginner level. Now I’m debating what to do for my MVP:

1. **Learn Frontend Myself**
   * It feels like a good long-term skill to have, and it would give me full control over the MVP. But  it’ll probably take time. 
2. **Hire a Frontend Developer**
   * This seems faster and would likely result in something more polished. But it’s obviously going to cost more, and I’d need to find someone reliable to work with.

I’m also wondering if there’s a middle ground—like learning just enough frontend to get the basics done and hiring someone for the tricky stuff or the final touches. **I don't want to end up in a loop where I try to do/develop everything myself and end up spending too much time on development, where the product does not reach daylight in the end (been there before).**

So, I thought I’d ask:

* If you’ve been in a similar position, what did you do?
* Is it worth learning frontend as a solo founder, or should I just bring someone in and focus on what I’m good at?
* Any tips for a good incentive structure / keeping costs low if I decide to hire someone?

6799340e3474f2d0be95d47e,1hlpdfj,Need an advice on my early startup's next steps,"Hey everyone, 1 month ago I released my B2B app and acquired my first users. (2 free, 2 paying customers). My user base is not technical people so having face-to-face meetings helps convince them which is what I did and I turned them into customers in 1 or 2 meetings.

I am a solo developer for this app and now I am in a place where I need to choose between a couple of options.

First I build the app with Firebase &amp; React Native. I also built a Node.js backend just in case but it has not been deployed since iterating with Firebase is fast and I don't want to deal with a migration now.  
I also have a full-time job, so I am using my spare time to develop the app, have meetings, etc.

I am concerned regarding the technical scale of this thing. So having my backend is always can increase the capabilities and reduce my cost. (Don't expect any huge costs until 10000 customers since it's firebase)

Option 1 (Introduce backend heavy co-founder):  
I have some friends who want to help the app, with decent backend knowledge. I can let them join, migrate the app, reduce the client-side login, own the FE &amp; Sales, and Let him handle the backend and own the FE in time.

Option 2 (Introduce frontend heavy co-founder):  
I don't have FE-heavy friends who are interested in the app currently, I can try to find someone with FE or Full Stack knowledge of my tech and offboard the technical stuff. Focus heavily on sales. Try to scale

Option 3 (Continue Solo)  
I can be more disciplined and scale this to, I guess 50 paying customers, and doing this may reduce the equity I give to other people or the investors. But, it will consume a lot of my energy.

Option 4 (Accelerators)  
Or I can try to create a deck and start looking for accelerators &amp; incubators, but being a solo founder is a negative point mostly, so this option can go hand in hand with op1 or op2

Additional information, I can sell the app, but I am really technical, and customer maintenance is manageable for at least 50 small businesses. Never tried marketing for an app, don't really know how to as well. Rather continue having face-to-face sales for the first 100 customers.

Also, my unit economics are fine, without any salaries, etc. for each customer, I charge 20$/month and they cost around 2$/month, I have other options with more margin for bigger customers, like 100$ etc, but I don't plan on them.

Any advice is really appreciated.",startups,1735083873.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hlpdfj/need_an_advice_on_my_early_startups_next_steps/
6799340e3474f2d0be95d47f,1hlpbr3,How do I build a tech startup if the products/services are too complicated for an initial proof of concept?,"I'm currently a graduate student and let's say I want to develop a startup that focuses of developing small nuclear reactors for data centers. As a nuclear engineering student, I might have a lot of knowledge about the feasibility of the project, what materials we might need and maybe I can run engineering simulations to demonstrate my idea. But there is no way I can develop a proof of concept, definitely not with the budget and support I get from my university, not to mention the safety hazard working on a nuclear system. Moreover, even a simple proof of concept device would require significant expertise from a variety of fields: electrical, mechanical, physics, chemistry, etc. While I might have a general idea, its nearly impossible to have all the knowledge to build it from scratch. Even if I work with a group of students, it would still be very hard with lack of tools, skills, and knowledge. In this case, what's the best way to go about initiating a startup? I would require multiple licenses, personnel, ample funding to even get to a proof of concept phase, not to mention building an actual reactor that is connected to the grid. 

This is just an example, but there are a lot of projects like this that are large in nature and might not follow the traditional pathway: research, develop proof of concept, pitch concept to investors, develop and refine, and then market. Many do, for instance, you can develop a software all by yourself and pitch it to investors, even small robots you can make a small scale prototype in a lab. But what about large projects like this? 3D printed rocket launch company, EV manufacturing company. Where do you even begin? Without a proof of concept, would investors give hundreds of thousands of dollars to a college student to start a capital intensive company?

1. Just get it working - We initially battled with serverless platforms like Google Cloud Run and Vercel for days to deploy because we needed a very specific environment to run a scraper. Just spin up an EC2 instance if you find yourself battling with any type of serverless infrastructure. It’ll take like an hour to deploy any application you want. You can always fix it later.
2. If you’re launching a time-consuming service, you need a way to save the work. - Our platform can take 5-10 minutes to complete a task. If the user clicked off the page in any way, it would throw off the app, and the task would fail. To remedy this, we quickly launched a concept of “jobs.” Now, every job you create is saved alongside its results as well, so you never lose information when you click off the page.
3. Launch with analytics - It's difficult to figure out what your users are doing with your product. Make sure you launch with analytics. We didn’t do that on our first launch and have no idea what users were using our platform for. We quickly integrated Mixpanel right after our first launch, and it's fun seeing what our users are doing!

6799340e3474f2d0be95d499,1hkl8bf,"Trying to build a new marketplace for India, struggling with GTM.","Hello!

So we've started a livestreaming marketplace in India after looking at the success of livestream commerce in China and the recent success in the US.

We're fairly early on in our careers and are people who are willing to experiment and wok hard, but its getting increasingly difficult to figure out how to take our product to market given we don't have a lot of runway left and we need to show some solid numbers to pick up venture funding.

There were companies who tried this model in India before during Covid when Tiktok got banned here, we've spoken to a bunch of them and figured out the core problems they faced.

\- They acted mostly as a replacement app to fill the tiktok void and commerce was added as a means to raise investor funding. Commerce was never the core focus.

\- They went after very indistinguishable products where the repeats were low (think cheap electronics, homeware)

\-They paid big influencers a bunch of money to come and do lives and burnt through cash.

\- Their primary audience was from semi urban, rural areas and hence the content on the app quickly moved to being super low quality.  
What we are doing differently :

\- Taking a commerce first approach and going after niche categories where users are super engaged and make purchases very often ( We are trying to pick and choose categories very carefully, have definitely made mistakes (we though thrifted apparel and handmade jewellery would do very well, but it came with a huge share of supply related ops issues), we accidentally stumbled on vinyl records as a category and it gave us really good results in the first few trial livestreams and hence we niched down to just focus on this category for a while. Even though the category is really small in India, users are super engaged (we had slightly more control over the supply as well).

\- We have completely stayed away from involving influencers / content creators for lives and even for our own social media content.

\- Similar to the Vinyl category, we plan to pick categories where the audience is super engaged, we can drive higher AOVs and create good content for the lives to be engaging. (The next few we are thinking of are sneakers, vintage collectibles, high value women's ethnic clothing and so on.)

We launched our app alpha in September this year, got a bunch of real user feedback, fixed bugs, figured we cant do without a web version, so launched the web version as well. We realised the app's UI and design wasn't that great, so we are revamping it too.

What we are doing on the marketing bit right now - Focusing on making really good quality social media content, making DIY content by ourselves, making content about the products on the platform and our sellers.

We have recently started to do offline popups to build more awareness. We also realised our branding was very off so we are getting that in line. Overall it feels very disorganised and unfocused, we have gotten the feedback that even though people think what we're doing is cool they don't always get what we're trying to do.

Can you guys suggest something we can do to leverage the limited time and resources we have before we run out of money. Any resources would be much appreciated too!",startups,1734950751.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hkl8bf/trying_to_build_a_new_marketplace_for_india/

6799340e3474f2d0be95d49d,1hkjca0,Help me pivot,"Dear fellow entrepreneurs,

I'm in need of some advice on how to pivot my product.

I'm working on an expenses tracker and the core tech &amp; UX design is solid. The web-app is centered around processing uploads of bank transactions and categorizing them.

Unfortunately I've just discovered that the core demographic of my MVP now has access to many of the features of my app through their banks native interface, which essentially undermines my value proposition for that user group.

That's a real shame of course because I was very close to launching the service which was scheduled for start for somewhere in Q2. The only steps that were left was hooking up a payment provider and making a landing page with a sales funnel plus some QA and pen-testing. 

So I'd say that was about 70\~75% of my MVP done and I now need a new plan. Honestly, although I'm bummed out, I rather find out now than getting feedback on launch that my app is a dud, so I also see this as an opportunity to take my code and see how I can move forward with it.

Here are a few opportunities that I've identified off the top of my head:

1. I could extend my app and move past the original scope of on-boarding user from a single bank and open it up to include multiple banks, which greatly increases my range, but also means much more work before I can go live at the risk of other banks beating me to the punch again...not likely, but there's always a risk.

2. Move away from mobile and web-apps and explore target the ""sit down to do your finances"" demographic aka boomers with a desktop view and the MVP accessible through the browsers, but later on building a desktop app. However this is a market that I'm totally unfamiliar with and also technically I'd be somewhat out of my depth...

I'd love to hear your thoughts on possible ways to position myself moving forward. All ideas and feedback are welcome :)",startups,1734941933.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hkjca0/help_me_pivot/

Solving problems nobody had, or couldn't market effectively. Whatever the reason, it was always months of building and then shutting it down 2 weeks after shipping.

This summer I started building tools for NSFW content, in fact one of those failed products was an adult content search engine. Yesterday I chose to make the tools open source, and when I shared them in the relevant communities they got immediate traction. The GitHub started getting stars, people began asking for a community around it. So I built a discord and a subreddit which each added 250+ users within 24 hours, and quickly growing.

It seems that I've hit on a nerve, a lot of developers are building products in this space and are frustrated with the lack of support. So I've started with open sourcing some utilities, but may end up taking it to a hosted SaaS depending on how demand looks.

People are talking about us being the first ones to ship NSFW videos models, and it's actually not too far out there and has like stupid market potential. The costs would be crazy high though to get going, at least for a few individuals. One of the reasons I made my tools open source was because I ran out of funds to keep exploring training models on my own.
