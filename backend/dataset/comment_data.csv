679934123474f2d0be95d4cc,m9mzgat,"Good evening,  
  
I am a student of Physics Honors. Over the past several years, I have been studying climate change in depth, understanding its physics, mathematics, economic impact, societal effects, and much more.  
  
I am currently working on a unique solution that, when sprayed from the sky using simple hydrogen balloons or agriculture aircraft, can sequester CO2 with very low activation energy. This solution will not only capture CO2, but it will also store it for millennia in solid form once it falls to the ground. Additionally, it has the potential to enrich the soil and benefit both humans and the environment, without causing any harm.  I have been studying in detail how carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) absorb heat through various modes, such as rotational at 2.3 micrometers, bending at 4.2 micrometers, and symmetric at 15.3 micrometers. Additionally, I have explored how the vibrational energy of these bonds is transferred to other molecules, like oxygen and nitrogen, through conduction, among other processes.  
  
I have delved deeply into this subject and have developed a specific solution of calcium hydroxide with 72.6% humidity. When this solution is sprinkled, particularly, it has minimal activation and quickly binds with CO2 in the air to form calcium carbonate (2.2 grams per square meter but depends on the ppm and other factors too). This process is environmentally friendly and offers benefits to both the environment and human health, as it is naturally occurring. By reducing the concentration of CO2 in cities—where levels are around 820 ppm—this solution can lower CO2 levels to approximately 258 ppm, effectively cooling the environment naturally and contributing to temperature reduction, along with several other advantages like providing a natural humidity to the human body and other living beings.  
  
I plan to file a patent for this and need to publish my research paper. I am conducting this study independently and require some necessary instruments like infrared gas sensors to obtain precise experimental readings. These instruments will be crucial in proving the effectiveness of my solution and in convincing others that it works.  
  
What should I do to complete it? It has become a paradox. To create a prototype and conduct experiments for research, you need funding, but to secure funding, you need a prototype, patents, or research that is ready for implementation. I need around $218. I’m not sure about other countries, but here, it’s a significant amount, and no one is willing to provide it as a grant.",1738073611.0,3,t3_1ic1lm8,startups

I will say, whenever asking someone else for advice about raising money, you should first ask them if they have successfully raised money before, if the answer is no then just walk away.  There are too many posers out there who would take a company like yours and, wring it for cash, and bring absolutely no value.

The main thing about raising money, get ready for A LOT of rejection, take it constructively, learn to parse what is being said (as it will never be just straight), and just keep going until it starts to click and you get investment.

""The Lean Startup"" by Eric Ries was a big eye-opener for me. It’s all about validating your idea as quickly as possible, which helped me avoid wasting time on stuff nobody wanted. Another one is ""Zero to One"" by Peter Thiel. It's a different perspective, focusing on unique insights and creating something truly new, which really clicked with me when I was trying to figure out how to differentiate what I was making. 

I also got a lot out of ""The Hard Thing About Hard Things"" by Ben Horowitz. It’s less about strategy and more about the emotional side of leading a startup. Made me feel like I wasn’t alone in facing all the chaos. Also, Reid Hoffman’s ""Blitzscaling,"" which explores the challenges of scaling rapidly, is quite insightful once you get to that point. 

I didn’t read all of these back-to-back or anything, it was more about picking up the right book at the right time, just when I needed a certain kind of advice or perspective.

With that being said, I am not sure exactly what feature you are trying to build, but wouldn't it be possible to create integrations between existing well established names in the accounting field and let user pay extra to automate some stuff. I did the same for my scheduling saas [https://manyseats.com/](https://manyseats.com/) where we needed the option to create video conference links but didn't want to integrate my own solution from scratch, thus we just integrated with Google (or any other provider of such services for that matter).

Thus users get something new, while at the same time still having access to their old software which worked fine for them. Not to mention that you don't have to spend tons of time reinventing the wheel and just focut in your important features.

Especially because you said that you are trying to automate things, I believe this will actually be better since most likely you would need all sort of integration (make taking some data from an invoice and sending it to a Google Sheets or something, just an idea).

A quick note, for accounting in particular keep in mind that different countries usually have systems that work very differently, for instance in Romania they are very particular about how an invoice should look like, thus a lot of American generated invoices are useless here.",1737993361.0,2,t3_1ibbwo0,startups

C) Put your product video in front of people who would use the product. 

D) Get their feedback: what's good, what's bad, would they pay for it, and are the advantages you'd give them enough to warrant the pain of conversion?

If enough people look at your video and say, ""yes, I'd totally switch to this product because those automations would be worth the hassle of switching"" then you move forward. 

If they don't, you iterate on their feedback and keep redoing your mockups and product video until you unlock enthusiasm. Or you don't move forward.

As an entrepreneur: 
We build similar software (would not be your competitor), there are established players in our market. There is a strategic reason that certain companies want to use our product over the main competitor, and that reason has little to do with how good our software is. So we have that advantage. Some of the feedback we get is to basically add more to the product to make it viable for them to buy it. If that strategic reason wasn’t there we’d probably have failed by now. The big obstacle has been the people in our market that have used the competitor for decades. People will readily admit that our software looks nicer and is more user-friendly; it’s the typically middle-aged users of our competitor that don’t want to change products. They don’t want to learn something new. If we talk to a company with younger users without experience with the competitor software they pick us, but you can imagine how long we would have to wait until the demographics of our market would change. The other hesitation is from management that don’t want to risk changing from a software that most everyone users to a new less-vetted one. So it’s possible, just an uphill battle. 

Audit compliance and other customer reviews can help overcome these obstacles. The latter has been harder to get. We’ve gotten positive feedback, but getting a *company* to put that in writing has been difficult. I’ve been advised to seek reviews from *people* rather than the companies they work for.

This is what most interns and even a few first years don't understand... no legit company is going to give a temporary intern significant work. The risks are just too big.

As an intern, you have two roles:

1) Taking on non-essential tasks to free up other employees

2) Waiting for a lull in people's schedules to ask them tons of questions and learn.

This means... going on coffee runs, picking up lunches, taking meeting notes, helping out with powerpoints, etc. When people seem to have a bit of free time, ask them to grab a coffee and learn as much as you can from them.

I don’t say that this will happen to everyone but there is a risk. Also, if it happens that you ask an investor for funding they will really appreciate if you have a CTO that is not a freelancer. 

Regarding the MVP, if you’re not a tech person it will of course be hard for you to develop the MVP. In fact, you don’t have to have one if you KNOW that what you want to develop really works.

Company Name: SportStake

Pitch: Sportstake is a daily fantasy sports pick’em platform that redefines how players engage with fantasy sports. For those unfamiliar, daily fantasy sports allow users to create rosters of real-life athletes and compete for prizes based on those athletes' real-world performances. However, most existing platforms offer limited functionality and overwhelming interfaces. Sportstake stands out by offering a fresh, innovative approach that focuses on user engagement, simplicity, and unique features.

The daily fantasy sports space is currently dominated by platforms like PrizePicks, Underdog, and Sleeper. While these platforms allow users to wager on player performance, they rely heavily on fixed lines set by the platform itself. Sportstake distinguishes itself by introducing two key innovations:

1. Fantasy Wager Marketplace.
2. Custom Line Creation.

Our mission is to transform the daily fantasy sports experience into something more interactive, personalized, and exciting. By empowering players to trade wagers and create their own lines, we aim to build a community-driven platform that redefines the competitive nature of fantasy sports.

We want someone who can help develop the iOS app, website, and Android app (back-end + front-end)

- Observe pain points in the world around you, learn to ask good questions, develop methods of assessing potential opportunities to create value 
- Investigate potential problem / solution spaces rapidly, obsessively, and deeply to thoroughly understand them 
- Learn to design and execute good experiments
- Practice asking for help, learn how to identify a good mentor, and find a few 
- Network and build relationships broadly, toward diversity of ideas / background / expertise / etc 
- Study business model patterns, mental models, decision making frameworks, and how to make cross-disciplinary insights.

6799341e3474f2d0be95d59a,m9du834,"I have these thoughts. I’m a fairly experienced developer with a lot of experience in software development. However, I’ve never launched a startup on my own. So I decided to start my own project. When it comes to designing, programming, and all sorts of technical tasks, I have no problems. But when I started preparing for the launch (that was last week), things got really tough. It requires a lot of creativity and experience in attracting attention to your product, etc. In short, without experience, I’ll say right away—it’s hard. It’s really difficult for me right now. I’m currently in the promotion stage, and everything feels a bit chaotic.

My advice: give it a try. Create a copy, but make it better, with your own ideas, and launch it. You need experience. Even if you have everything—an idea, a team, money—but no experience in seeing things through and doing it the right way, you’ll make a lot of mistakes.

1️⃣ **Your Idea Will Evolve**: The idea you start with is rarely the one you’ll stick with. As you build, engage with users, and get feedback, it’ll naturally refine into something stronger and more valuable.

2️⃣ **Momentum Matters**: Action creates momentum, and momentum attracts opportunities. Apply to accelerators and competitions—they’ll push you to refine your idea, connect you with mentors, and build your network.

3️⃣ **Hustle Trumps Perfect Conditions**: No one ever has the perfect skills, capital, or network to start. These come *after* you dive in. Research your market and competitors, but don’t let that stop you—figure out why you’re different and lean into it.

**Bottom line**: The best way to learn and grow is by starting. The earlier you fail, adapt, and iterate, the faster you’ll build something truly valuable.

All the successful entrepreneurs here have either: a spouse with good benefits, or the live with a relative like a sibling/parent.

Sign up for a nice gym with drop in daycare. You get 2 hours of daycare per day. In theory, you could join two gyms, and have two slots. 

Find a church, or other house of worship that has a strong enough children's program that they have full time childrens Ministry staff and Summer Bible Camp.

You don't have to be really religious, just a seeker... and you can meet other parents to trade baby sitting with... also teens from big families that will baby sit... and usually Wednesday night kids events where you can go off site &amp; come back after 2.5 hours, plus some have a ""Mommy's Day Out"" half day daycare program for Tues and Thurs.  

If you find another couple working parents that way, you can take the whole crew to indoor play parks, and tag team watching the kids while the other one works on a laptop nearby.

You can work at the cafe tables at; the trampoline park, the indoor playground at the zoo, the mall with the climbing thingy, that one Burger King that still has a playplace, Chic Fil a, gymnastics open gym on Fridays, the community center open gym, etc.

Get on your facebook to find parent groups and ask them where you can take your kids indoors to play mid week. They will hook you up.

Keeping your house clean under duress means making choices. Switch to paper plates &amp; plastic cutlery. Put cleaning supplies in every room. Vacuum on each floor. 

Stop doing any sorting and golding for clothes. Get 20-30 mesh lingerie bags, and a pop up hamper for each person. Hang the lingerie bags AS hampers for small items socks, underwear, bras etc. When the big hamper is 80% full for that person, close the bags and drop them in the hamper and carry it to the laundry room. Replace the pop up and bags with empties. Clean socks etc. get dumped into the drawer, no sorting. 

Get some care.com baby sitters on the roster as ""Mother's helpers"" where you are home, but they are watching the kids. You need to sort for people who will do that type of work. Some will bring their own kids, etc. Ideally get someone who can pickup/drop off for school stuff too.

Some cases it may be better to drop to weekends or simply quit. I know this sounds shallowly based but if you are building something of value it is only a matter of time before you succeed. So make more time to build. Also do not live outside your means.

The tips I have for you is to work when you get the chances and when you spend time with the family focus on that and be present. Rather have 1 hour really focused playtime with kids than 2-3 hours where you look on phone and half working. 

For me I work when they are at preschool then when they come home (16:00-17:00) (if I don’t have any meetings) I play with them and fix dinner. 
After kids bed time (19:00) I go back to work until around midnight. It’s of course a bit tricky sometimes and you need to be flexible and don’t beat yourself up if things don’t go as planned.

Wake up at 5:30, put in an hour before kids wake up. On weekends try to find a 3-4 hour block.

Here is what I suggest:

1. Try to build with non-technical AI tools such as Lovable, Bolt, Tempolabs. Use their free tiers and check if you can build something decent first. If it hooks you, deepen your technical skillset but don't expect to match a dev, only for prototyping purposes.
2. Strengthen your sales skills regardless.

You don’t need to know how to build a full front-end and back-end from scratch without AI, but now with AI tools, it’s easy to build an MVP. You can’t do everything on your own. At some point, you’ll need a technical co-founder or developer whom you can compensate with equity (ESOPs) to keep them motivated in your company. But it’s crucial to understand the basics so people can’t scam you and you don’t end up hiring someone who doesn’t know their stuff.

Most technical founders lack sales skills, so if you’re a great sales and marketing person, they’ll need you anyway. However, I would never outsource development to an agency because development should be in-house, either through a co-founder or employees.

I’m not saying you can’t do both on your own, but with a co-founder, you’ll have much higher leverage of your time and can use that to master your skills.

Learning new things is a big dopamine hit for me and keeps me going.

Positive user feedback and interactions also keeps me going - signal that what I'm doing is valuable to people.

Staying grounded instead of focusing too much on investors, advisors, or events, or even necessarily growth. Don't compare to anyone. You can reference, but every startup has unique circumstances.

Theres always stress and I embrace it as a driver for growth. When it piles up high enough it's usually a sign I need to learn something. When I learn that thing, the stress goes away again.

Doing hard things will never be painless. It's part of the deal.

Also long walks in nature are super nice.

I've usually hit burnout before when my actions weren't leading to results, and I wasn't learning new things. I felt stuck. Or when I felt stuck due to co-founder relationships. Or when I put too much focus on how investors thought about my business. Or when I ran out of money and it was time to call it quits.

Of course a startup is ""never ending"". We're building value for people, and there's always lots more value we can add. You really can't be in this thinking about the ""end point"".  Maybe ask yourself why you're thinking of it as a race? 

This is a lifestyle, not a temporary program. This isn't the rat race. The rat race was going to a job I didn't really love and daydream of working on my own projects or where I'd go on the weekend. That race was circular and the clock reset every monday.

1.Burnout hit me hardest about 2 years into my entrepreneurship journey. I was trying to do everything myself, working 80+ hour weeks, and neglecting my health and relationships. It felt like I was sprinting a marathon.

2.What actually helped:

- Learning to delegate and build a support network
- Implementing strict boundaries around work hours 
- Focusing on physical health (sleep, exercise, nutrition)
- Regular breaks and time completely disconnected from work
- Finding ways to reconnect with my ""why"" and passion

What was BS:
- ""Hustle harder"" mentality 
- Thinking I could power through it
- Quick fixes like productivity hacks or apps

3.My blind spot was thinking I had to do it all myself and that asking for help was a sign of weakness. I had to learn that building a strong team and support system is crucial.

Some resources that helped me:
- ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport for focus and time management
- ""Essentialism"" by Greg McKeown for prioritization
- Therapy/coaching for stress management

Remember, sustainable growth is better than burning out. Take care of yourself - you're the most important asset in your business.

When I was in the thick of startup mode, finding an agency that got it was like searching for a needle in a haystack. They all talk about shiny, feel-good metrics like ‘vanity metrics,’ right? Followers or likes or whatever. But when it came down to hardcore revenue growth and ROI, it just felt like they fell short.

I actually ended up switching gears. Instead of hiring another agency, I started focusing more on building a small in-house team. It was tough initially, getting people who genuinely went after revenue growth but eventually we figured it out. I found that sometimes hiring enthusiastic and adaptable people directly, and training them with a clear focus on revenue goals, made a huge difference. It took time, but the impact was more direct.

I also made it a point to tie our marketing campaigns back to sales metrics, almost obsessively. I’m talking regular meetings with the sales team and constant feedback loops to really drive that alignment between marketing efforts and sales outcomes.

So either focus on hiring sales reps or get a marketing guy, yes 1 guy who has a deep focus on how to scale first with specialized strategy and then diversify as you grow.

I don’t regret most of those mistakes, as they were valuable lessons. However, one major thing I regret is not letting a person go even after realizing that they had issues with intent. People who have skill issues but are willing to learn will eventually improve and prove themselves. But people with intent issues are detrimental to your startup, especially when you're trying to grow fast. They slow down your growth, and you may keep giving them chances, hoping they’ll get better.

This advice below is for both startups and more mature companies (heck, for any company at any stage of it's lifecycle). 

1. Firing legacy employees that don't have a growth mindset

2. A subset of item #1 is allowing employees to horde company information or processes so that they are the only one's who know that information and/or process. They do this because they think it gives them job security. 

3. Hiring people who have the skills we're looking for but who don't fit into our company culture or align with our corporate values. These people have to go ASAP.

4. Not firing people who gossip and are constantly at the epicenter of drama. 

5. Not training my people to come to me only when they can't figure out solutions as opposed to coming to me constantly to solve problems. That's what I hired you to do...so solve them.

6. Hiring family/friends. It's hard to fire them if (when) they don't work out. Only hire them if you are 100% certain it won't harm the relationship if you have to let them go. Even if you think you are 100% certain that it won't harm the relationship, you are almost certainly wrong.

7. Not firing someone the minute you start having second thoughts. If you're having second thoughts, make them first thoughts and fire them. 

8. Not documenting what people do wrong and what you did correct the situation. Do this, then give them the minimum severance needed with a signoff from them that they aren't going to sue you and you've treated them fairly, with all the blah, blah, blah legaleze that is required in your state. 

I could go on, but this is a good start as to who not not hire and/or who should be fired ASAP. 

Now, what should you do?

Realize what makes a business successful. They are, in this order:

Marketing: It doesn't matter how good of a product you have or how good your salesmen are if you can't create a constant flow of high quality prospects.

Sales: It doesn't matter if you have a constant flow of high quality prospects if you have no system/process or lack the right people to sell your product/service.

Service: It's one thing to land a quality clients, but it's even more profitable in the long run to have clients that stick with you or customers who repeat their purchase.

Learn how to build and run a business: 

Too many (most?) entrepreneurs/founders/creators/inventors think that because it's their baby, they must be in constant control of their business...and don't realize that they have no idea how to run a business. Chances are you are wrong. Surround yourself with people who understand operations and who have organizational skills...people how know how to sell and, how to train a sales organiztion, and how to run a sales organization (training and running are almost always two different skill sets, so don't confuse the two. 

Get people in who understand finance and how to run the financial operations of your company. Your buddy who is an accountant or your parents accountant is almost ceratainly NOT that person. 

Get someone who knows how to do marketing. They don't have to be creative, they just need to have the contacts who are creative as well as other markting contacts. I've often thought of a CMO as me hiring a person with some organizational and research skills that has a quality rolodex (I know I'm dating myself by using the term ""rolodex""). 

Form banking relations early and often. Build relationships and get lines of credit (LOC) even if you don't need them...then tap into them once in a while to keep them live and pay them off in a timely manner. If you do this and build a reputation with quality lenders, it will be easier to get access to capital when you actually need it or want it.

Get good lawyers: Notice, I didn't say ""lawyer"", I said ""Lawyers"" (plural). Get lawyers that specialize and know what they are doing. Do NOT skimp on this matter. Cheap lawyers will cost you money later...often much more money...and sometimes a cheap lawyer will cost you everything. 

Build and run your business as if you plan on selling it tomorrow (even if you don't plan on selling it). Always have your business in tip top shape to sell, even if you never plan on selling it. If you do this, you will find that you have a valuable business that is paying you a lot of money. 

Don't get emotionally attached to your business...do NOT make it your identity. It is merely an investment that gives you a lifestyle and security. Treat your business like any investment. You never marry your investments, you only date them...and you only date them as long as you are getting what you want from them/it. Once it stops giving you what you want, you break up with it. If you have to break up with it and you've followed my advice to build your business like you plan on selling it tomorrow, you'll be fine. 

This also applies to employees. Don't get emotionally attached to them. That doesn't mean you shouldn't like them (you should) or care about them (you should). But never confuse friendship and business. 

Don't confuse being self-employed with owning a business. They are two completely different things.

You're goal should be to build a ""self-managing, self-growing business"". If you build that, you've got something really special! 

I could go on and on about this, but that's a pretty good list of things I wish I knew when I started in business for myself back in January of 1987.

Go there, *talk* to people, help them out, and if it makes sense, casually drop the app. No one likes being sold to, so don’t force it.

Another thing? Content. Keep it raw. Share a bit about what your app solves or even the struggles of building it—people eat that up. Oh, and track how people are using it from day one. Data shows you stuff you’d miss, like where users are bouncing or getting confused. It’s not glamorous work, but it’s what gets you those first loyal users.

Every single organization I've been part of that has a shitty culture, whenever I looked closer there's always something about the leadership. 

Once joined an industry organization and all the women were so hostile and on edge. Whenever I talked to any of them they always so snobby and acting all weird.

The short story is you either have to take it upon yourself to talk to the founders (fix) or leave and find another job (leave) it depends on your relationship with them. If they don’t care about culture (because it’s not revenue generating, harder to measure, etc) then it won’t get fixed.

This happened to me at my first startup. I was young and ambitious but also too introverted and not very confident. I was a good judge of work but not character.

It's especially shitty if you are a direct report to someone that is toxic. In that case likely you need to walk away. If you can't avoid the toxicity, it doesn't matter how the startup is. Your work life will suffer and you won't learn and grow - which is the point of joining a company so early. High risk, but high learn rate.

If you can avoid toxicity, try to be responsible and submit good work. Don't participate in rumors and personal attacks. Be accountable. Submit reports and ask questions. Ask about improvements in a non judgmental way. Suggest things that might be better. Talk to users yourself.

If the founders recognize and suddenly you're spending more time with them - maybe they weren't so bad and can slowly shift the company in time to performers like you and away from the toxicity.

However, equity is just a concept until your company is officially registered and the equity is documented on paper—which doesn’t need to happen immediately. I would suggest starting with an arrangement where equity distribution is proportional to the time, effort, and money each person is contributing. Over time, you might notice that one person is working harder than the others, or some members may drop off before the product reaches the market.

When the time comes for the actual distribution of equity, you’ll have a much clearer understanding of how it should be divided.

My 2 cents. If these are relationships you value I’d think very seriously about reframing how you are thinking about this. The reason I bet equity hasn’t came up is because the other side is looking at this as they’d be interested I being cofounders. If you think you can carve off 15-20% to split among them and you keep the rest this will probably end really badly. Ideas are dime a dozen. Even good ones are overvalued. Sure, a good idea beats a bad one, but execution is everything and unless you can do everything on your own, the value of having people as committed as you cannot be understated enough. 

Everyone who gets equity should vest over a long period of time. 4 years is standard for employees, but cofounders I think 6-8 years is practical and reasonable. You put a 1 year cliff so if they leave in the first year they get nothing, then the rest they get monthly thereafter (the get 1/8th if it was vested over 8 years, on the first anniversary). That includes you for the record. I’ve revested equity in startups I was a solo founder of when we have raised round of investment as well, and it’s not unreasonable for the whole founding team to do this. 

Outside of that, more companies are killed by cofounder break up vs. anything else which is worth remembering.

# pros:

* you’re in your early 20s with no debt, savings, and no major responsibilities—this is the *perfect* time to take risks.
* the startup aligns with your passion for entrepreneurship, and even if it fails, the experience will be gold for your resume and future ventures.
* moving closer to family/friends and escaping a city you don’t like is a massive quality-of-life boost.

# cons:

* yeah, it’s risky, but you’ve got a fallback: your savings and 2+ years of experience at a big-name company. if the startup doesn’t work out, you’re still employable, especially since recruiters love “founding engineer” experience.
* job market sucks, but for someone with no responsibilities and your skills, the risk is manageable.

# my 2 cents:

if you’ve been dreaming about startups and *not taking this* feels like something you’d regret, just go for it. it’s rare to get an opportunity with someone you trust, a matched salary, and equity. worst case, you fail, learn a ton, and bounce back stronger.

life’s too short to stay comfy and wonder “what if.” take the leap, my dude—you’ll grow way more in a dynamic startup than at a slow corporate job. good luck! 🚀",1737843726.0,2,t3_1i9xgko,startups

1. You ll be surprised how less of the time you would have for networking in the early stages of building a startup as an engineer.
2. If you’re a founding engineer, they will come to you and discuss things and you ll be their the m technical guy. So no, this is not the opportunity to grow out of a strictly technical role.
3. You ll be surprised how overrated it is to move closer to your friends and family. After the initial excitement, things become very boring very quickly.
4. You said that the startup has raised some money? Then there’s going to be red tape on every decision that is made in that company.

Now, my thoughts-
1.  Your Age is what you have going for you. You’re so young that even if this is a mistake, you have ample of energy to make it right. Job market isn’t going to stay bad always. 
2. IMO, people shouldn’t do startups because they want to do startups or it is in trend. You should build a startup if you feel truly passionately about a problem that needs solving. Because the journey is so so so mind numbing that it will make you lose even the tiniest bit of self-respect and peace of mind. That kind of life won’t seem worth-it until you absolutely believe in solving the problem. From an engineer to another, there are so many pivots and fights and pressure that “learning” starts to take a back seat. This also takes over your entire personal life.

Having said all that, if my 20 year old kid comes to me and tells me that they want to do a startup. I’d first urge them to take a sabbatical from work and go travel for some time. Because if you’re one bored at your high paying cushy job, then there are other ways to add adventure to your life.

&gt; Loss of benefits 

These sentences don’t fit together. I get that you’re probably talking about take home pay, but benefits are important. 

A very important point to keep in mind: your current stage of life is the best time to take risks, but it is also the very most important and powerful time to be contributing to retirement accounts. Don’t underestimate those benefits. 

And aside from that benefits like health insurance should be considered income. 

&gt; less/no work life balance

You’ll get different opinions on this, but it’s a red flag to me. Spending free time working on your startup as a founder is one thing, but expecting death march hours from early employees is not fair. Additionally, if you’re going to be in that sort of environment, make sure you are familiar with available sociological research on burnout/crunch. In most cases, long term significant overtime is actually counterproductive. 

And don’t lose sight of the fact that most startups fail. You’ll be working hard on something where the mostly likely outcome is that the value of your equity goes to zero. 

I’d definitely lean towards a no on this opportunity from a career/financial perspective. But only you can decide if taking that likely hit is “worth it” for the personal intangibles like living in a different city.

And in fact they allow the learning curve to drop precipitously. Here's what I did:

Learn JavaScript. Its not a hard language. You will need html and css too but those are even easier, they are markup languages.

Choose a back end service. I like firebase by google, others like AWS, whatever. Don't focus on which one is *best*, choose based on which one you feel more comfortable with understanding, especially the documentation.

Choose and learn a frontend framework, such as Vue or React or Angular. I recommend Vue. Frameworks don't do anything that you can't do in JavaScript on your own, but they speed up development and automate a lot of redundancy. They allow you to write less code to achieve the same things. 

Along with your framework will come a number of styling/component libraries. I like Vuetify to go with Vue. These speed you up by letting you write one or a few lines of code to place an entire component (for example a drop down menu), while also keeping consistent style.

That might seem like a lot, but it's really not. I'm a dedicated week you can have the basics of all that down and start coding.

The benefits of all those stacks are to allow you to focus on all your application's logic. They allow you to not have to think very much about how your data is being written, read, and secured, and to instead focus on what your user is doing with that data.

Its not no code, but the gap between you now and you writing apps using that stack is not nearly as big as you think.

Let me break it into 5 steps I use when working with Founders in this same rut.

1. Start with the problem - not the product.  
  
Building a product in a vacuum leads to endless tweaking because you don’t have a clear measure for ""success"". I push founders to identify a real problem that someone (ideally, a specific group of people) is struggling with. 

A good problem is:

• Painful: It’s something people *really* NEED solved, not just a nice-to-have.

• Frequent: It happens often enough that solving it provides value and people are  reminded of its existence.

• Specific: You can explain it in a single sentence, like: “College grads struggle to track job applications effectively.”

  
2. Talk to Real People

Find potential users and ask them about their problems. I love Rob Fitzpatrick's ""Mom Test"" book for this. Talking to real people will give you clarity on whether your idea is relevant and what “done” looks like - because you can assess how well or to what degree the current state addresses the problem. No more guessing if it needs more features.

  
3. Solve Just One Part of the Problem

Your first project doesn’t have to be complicated or perfect. It just needs to solve *one* aspect of the problem well. Really well.  
  
For example:

• Instead of building a full-featured job application tracker, start with a simple spreadsheet-like app that makes it easy for those college grads to keep tabs.

  
4. Validate Really Fast

Build the simplest version of your solution (an MVP) and test it with users to see if it actually solves their problem. If they use it, give feedback, or are willing to pay for it, you’re on the right track. If not, adjust based on what you’ve learned. Don't try to solve it all - learn one thing at a time and keep moving.

5. Admit that done enough IS  done enough

When users start telling you, “This solved my problem!” or “This is helpful, but it would be better if it did X,” you know you’re making strides. These conversations replace the guesswork about whether you’re procrastinating or improving.

  
So, by starting with a real problem, you’ll always know whether you’re making meaningful progress because the goal becomes concrete - it's impacting that problem positively, if not completely.

Other people on this thread talk about A) .. so Ill talk about B) being able to deliver the tech

But first .. you live in an incredible time - imo, the next 5 years will have so many startups use deep neural nets and cheap compute to solve real problems that only humans could do before.  In my case, Im working on turning point-cloud scans of buildings into 3D CAD models automatically.   There is a lot of hype around LLMs, but I would actually be looking for problems that Reinforcement Learning can now solve that could not be solved just a couple of years ago.

[ btw, Reinforcement Learning is basically deep Neural Net meets computed simulation .. like in a chess game where the neural net guesses the best 3 moves from its learned experience, then it simulates many games forward to evaluate the best of those 3 ] 

A couple days ago, there was a great advance in AI with the deepseek LLM - basically they improved an LLMs reasoning by using Reinforcement Learning in a creative way : very readable non-math paper here : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948



In your case, based on your comments [ Data Science major ] .. I think you actually need deeper experience as a developer, to be a good tech founder - but no-one can stop you from getting that yourself.  You will not get this at university / college, but the math/calculus/algebra/programming/algorithms/compsci theory learning is really important also.

So.. once you find a good A) problem .. then I recommend take that on as a harder B) side project, go a bit larger and deeper than what you have done before to make a Proof of Concept pre-MVP.   

Your university might have a pitching contest or startup / tech / biz meetups / competitions .. its also good to force yourself to present your idea

If you have used javascript, I recommend looking at using it in a more functional way, Ramda.js is a good example.    For theory, if you havent seen something like the SICP lisp material, study some of that .. it will expand your mind.


Worst case, you push yourself and learn a lot on the side project .. best case it looks like it has wings and you may know a cofounder at your college and decide to turn that into the startup.

Look around at the world .. there are many problems that need solving.  We have tools now that we never had before.  Maybe you will invent a new way for people to fund useful local projects on their smartphone, like putting solar panel shades over grazing animals or parking lots .. or micro funding of startups .. or auctioning of food waste or refuse materials to better allocate resources .. or sift plastics from waterways ?

Your idea sounds cool, but to get investment, you need to do the work to flesh out it out a lot more. For example. You need to perform market research, user research to give evidence of a willing market. You’ll also have to build a more detailed design with a grasp of the tech that might be needed and the features you’d build. Then you’d probably have to technically validate it - is it feasible, and how much will it cost. You’d build a prototype (or even a concept art) to show potential customers to gauge willingness. You’d have to have a business model and go-to-market strategy. Probably likely some metrics that show traction, like a waitlist. 

Then you put it all into a pitch deck and practice pitching. If you got rich friends and family, pitch to them first. They might even let you skip a few of these due diligence steps. If you don’t, you need to do all of it, likely with a confounding team that has a good mix of tech/business expertise and go to startup mixers to build networks into angels or apply for accelerators and VCs straight out.

Your alumni network is a good place to start, along with seeing what startups are related to the university where you got your PhD. The first startup I joined was doing work at the university where I was getting my PhD, so I approached them to see if they needed an engineer. At the time, they were contracting work at the university that was very similar to what I was doing for my thesis. I got hired as their first full-time employee.

Wellfound is a site where startups will post jobs. Many VCs will also post jobs available at their portfolio companies. You can also check LinkedIn. Many times, though, due to the potential high costs of recruiting, startups will hire through word-of-mouth. Which comes right back to networking!

Considering you have a PhD, then you likely have specialized knowledge and experience that will fit really well with the right startup. Take a targeted approach to finding those startups where your skill set will be invaluable. Even if they don't have a job posted, it can't hurt to contact them. Maybe you can initially consult with them and eventually get hired. This is how I got my 2nd startup job.

What you call interesting sometimes involve more drama than in the Housewives of-franchaise, with you (as a non-founder) sitting there like an unwanted child getting weaponized/abused during an epically bad divorce by a group of polyamorous drunkards.

That whole ""they can pay a salary""-thing is a watershed moment that you ideally want to happen after you've joined, so that you don't end up as just one of many new recruits after they've raised a lot of money (when there's lots of new people with no established company culture etc). Or, you want the business to already have stabilized with decently sized teams, but that's probably beyond what you'd call an interesting time; so you'd be back to simply doing a regular job.

My most helpful advice would be to network within your local startup scene. Get a feel for what's out there, whom to trust, and hopefully get noticed by some investors that would want your particular skills to help strengthen a business that they've already invested in.

679957c2bc2da6070616915e,m8y30kv,"Hey all, I don't usually share this kind of stuff, but I'm in a bit of a rough spot, so I would greatly appreciate some advice.

I launched my app startup about a month ago, with what I think are pretty good initial metrics (600 users, 20 paying, 600$ earned). However, the subscription sign-ups have begun to fall off, mainly due to the app not working properly, as in, we get user reports a few times per week saying that they aren't able to use the app at all. Sadly, I only have one developer who is able to commit \*\~\*24h/week as he's busy with other projects, so effectively none of the critical issues have been resolved so far. I've also recently talked to a developer who used to work on the project, asking me if some very critical DB issues (basically the whole thing can fall apart at any moment) have been resolved, which to his surprise weren't, so he raised his concerns on whether the current developer is competent enough to handle of it.

I've been in the process of building this startup for about 3 years now. Up until launch, we were steadily getting sign-ups, about 5/day on our smoke-screen landing page with basically zero promotion and all organic Google searches. There were 3 times when a developer dropped and another one joined in (they were all students with many shifting priorities), making the code ever more convoluted and undocumented. At the same time, I was in touch with one of my friends who owns a product agency. After the second developer quit, he offered to help out to keep the product going as he believed in its metrics. In exchange for 49%, he got one of his developers to help out but the overall their contribution was very minimal as the third developer (still with the team at that point) knew the code better and didn't want to bother with onboarding. As he eventually quit, the agency friend offered a full commitment to the product on the condition we do a three-way split with him and his other agency partner. And this leads us to where we are now, where their one developer, with limited stack familiarity, is split between 3 different projects. As the friend's main competence is in sales and marketing, he mostly pushes for lead generation, yet from my view we're just funneling all new users into a brick wall. He also has a tendency to act on his gut and pushes product ideas without much thought, often bypassing set priorities.

Little before the launch, I also lost my full-time job and based on the friend's wishes decided to postpone my job search for two months to fully commit to the startup. However, it's been a month now, and due to the described situation, things do seem to not be moving in a direction where this could create revenue to support me. I've also started to seriously doubt the competence of the whole product agency.

So what do you all think? Should I just accept that the moment wasn't right, things didn't align and quit the whole thing? Should I lower my contribution and start treating it as a side hustle again and being job search? Or is it just one of those bad early-stage things that will eventually pass and I should keep going?",1737740687.0,2,t3_1i8swit,startups

Definite changes though are;
1. Offering local languages (these people can't speak English!)

2. Price or atleast some kind of introductory offer to gauge pricing like is it $10? $100? $1000 minimum for a 6 week course? -&gt; this is the biggest click off for me

3. No information on what the course entails or how good a teacher you are. You should have some video snippets of a course in action or a curriculum we can peruse.

Also, paid ads for something like this is meant to be a growth catalyst but you're missing the core ingredients. 

Put together some FREE downloadable learning resources that you offer in exchange for signing up to the mail list. Stuff like a quick phrase handbook or start a blog/vlog on like best places to visit as an English speaker; London, LA, Sydney, Malta etc... 

I'd also say with the advent of so many fun games and apps like Duolingo you need to either be fun and engaging (see the point above about seeing HOW you teach) and why your better than a free app OR you need to go after rhe professional market and instead be teaming up with companies who do a lot of foreign business and become their defacto language tutor for all new hires/recurring training.

How many stockholders and investors do you have? Have you signed any personal guarantees regarding loans or investment agreements? 

Who is ""we"" when you say you are a ""single founder"" 

If you have a legit board, and other stockholders, you can't unilaterally decide to wind down the company -- that would ordinarily be a decision only the board is allowed to make.

You should probably start by assessing of the company's assets, current stakeholders, and send out a letter proposing that the company be wound down due to specific reasons. If your product needs specific things to be market ready, provide reasonable estimates of what it would take to get there. 

That being said, you can always leave the company, resign your board seat, and forefeit your equity, or threaten to do so to add urgency to the situation. But if others want to continue the company in your absence, you might have an unpleasant fight ahead. You may also be able to sell the company's assets (presumably product prototypes / code / designs and rights thereto) to one of the investors in exchange for walking away.",1737681491.0,3,t3_1i8f0bc,startups

Assume that your perspective is too small-scale, that you are blind to those things that no matter the tools can't be built in a matter of weeks (or even months), and now reread your lil statement about validating before building not being relevant.

Also, why waste a whole ass week before you have to validate it anyway, to learn what to focus on to get people to like what you're building, or how to best market it to resonate with their wants and needs?

There's just no way around it, you always need to build a business based on what people, indirectly or not, communicate to you about it.

So it's only a question about what you're using when you're validating. It could be prepared statements, it could be concept drawings, it could be a POC, or it could even be an MVP, and that's decided by whatever factors are relevant in your case.

679957cebc2da60706169250,m91b2i1,"&gt;Anyone knows of experiences where taking the plunge has NOT turned out well? 

Yes, 99% of them.

&gt;Seems like most online stories are mostly positive and meant to inspire, understandably haha.

Sure, because most people prefer to tell stories of success, rather than stories or crashing and burning.

Before you quit, ask yourself a few questions:

* what measurable milestones do you need to achieve to ""take the plunge""?
* how long is your personal runway?
* what measurable milestones would you need to achieve to extend your runway? when would you need to achieve them? 
* what does getting another job look like, if this fails? (the time to find another job should NOT be part of your person runway.)
* how do your answers compare with your co-founder?

You and your co-founder need to be on the same page with this. Answer these separately, then compare your answers. I wouldn't go full-time/take the plunge if my co-founder wasn't doing the same.

Deciding to take the plunge is easy: it's just about how much you can afford to lose. Assume worse-case scenario. Then it's just about making sure you don't lose MORE than that or more than you need to. Decide when you'll get out BEFORE you get in.

If you want to raise VC investment, you'll likely need to quit before you get investment (there are always exceptions, but you are probably not one of them). So if I were you, I'd get a very good understanding of what VCs want and expect before taking the plunge. You don't want to quit your job and then find out that no VC will ever invest in your idea, if that's what you were counting on.",1737776569.0,2,t3_1i7ztrf,startups

VCs love the ""ex-colleagues on the same team, college friends or roommate"" story -- just to show that you and your co-founder have been through high stress times together before and survived. So maybe re-connecting with other alumni or cohort batch from previous schools or jobs on LinkedIn would be helpful.

If you don't have that luxury or don't really care for VC funding, I found my co-founder on the YC co-founder matching app. Turns out we actually had a lot of mutual friends and background and so that helped us build repertoire really quickly. We then started co-working remotely and in person regularly and started from there.  
  
I heard of a new app called CoffeeSpace that helps you connect with other potential co-founders too. But really just go on any platform that allows you to meet new interesting people (in the field that you want) quickly. So i'd say, go to events, join discord channels or groups, meetup etc.  


* What qualities or skills do you think are most important in a non-technical co-founder?

I've been both a first-hire and a technical co-founder. Based on my experience, the most important thing is for you both to share the same overarching vision and goals, or at least be sure on how your goals can be aligned.  
  
Other important skills for a non-technical co-founder would be to things like:

1) Being responsive -- they'll probably do most of the customer facing interaction so these people can't be your typical 'bad texter'  
2) Being ballsy and thick-skinned (they really need to shameless in getting your product in front of people)  
3) Have good product, industry and user intuition, or at least be willing to put in time to pick this up. In the early stages there's going to be a lot of iteration on the PMF and trying to understand what users actually want and how to ask them question.   
4) High responsibility and ownership -- I'm assuming the non technical co-founder would be doing a lot of admin work like the legal, HR, taxes etc. You'll probably want someone who you can trust to get things done so that you don't get distracted by these things

  
That being said these skills are all dependent on the actual job scope. If you plan to take on some of these jobs yourself then maybe just a co-founder whose skills are complementary to yours.",1737622123.0,1,t3_1i7yjwu,startups

Like connecting with people whose work you admire and genuinely chatting up in industry-specific communities or on social media. Sometimes, just putting yourself out there with helpful insights or starting a conversation about topics you’re passionate about helps. It’s less about selling and more about connecting over common interests.

Hey! Take it easy on yourself and enjoy this phase of exploring the idea. Product ideas are very often REALLY different from the products that eventually make it to market.  So best to refine the idea before we jump to the cost and complexity of patents. 

Focus on validation first. Do customer interviews (Rob Fitzpatrick wrote a great book called ""The Mom Test"" that will help you nail them). Look at forums where people discuss the problem you want to solve. Spend time steeping in the problem. How real is it? How important is it? People don't buy products, they buy solutions to problems. So, make sure you've got a great problem - the product idea you have no may or may not be the ultimate solution - but if you get nerdy about the problem, you can get there. But make sure its real and people care to solve it - if they don't, you don't need a patent, because they don't need the product.

You can then do some preliminary research on patents - us the CIPO (Canadian Intellectual Property Office) and/or Google Patents database. See what exists that might be close.

Interestingly, there are a couple big reasons startups fail, and you can evaluate these prior to spending significant time and money on a startup:

1) Do you or do you not have customer validation? Where validation means they actually took out and swiped their credit card to pay for your offering. Until you have validation, it is just theory.

2) Is the timing good? Often a good idea is too soon for the market. For example, I don't think you could have started a ride share or short term rental offering back in 1994, not because it wasn't a good idea, but you need the internet to make it work at any kind of scale. 

There are many other reasons startups fail, such as lack of funding, poor management, cofounder riffs, competitive pressure, supply chain issues, etc., etc., etc., but these are all after you've started.

**Network Effects** 
The value of the product increases as more users join the platform.

- Facebook/IG: More users mean more connections, increasing the value of the network.
- Linkedin: The platform becomes more valuable as professionals and recruiters join.

**Economies of Scale**
Cost advantages as production scales.

- Amazon: Scale allows lower prices due to efficiencies in logistics/inventory management/competition.
- Tesla: Manufacturing at scale has reduced costs per unit, making the cars cheaper over time.

**Brand and Trust**
A strong brand that customers associate with quality, reliability, and status.

- Apple: The brand's reputation for innovation and quality makes it hard for competitors to lure away.
- Nike: A lifestyle brand built around athletes and high performance.

**Proprietary Technology**
Technology that's difficult to replicate or innovate around.

- Google Search: Superior algorithms that continuously improve through data.
- SpaceX: Proprietary reusable rocket technology.

**High Switching Costs**
Making it costly or inconvenient for customers to switch to competitors.

- Microsoft Office: Files/workflows/skills tied to the software creates dependencies. 
- Salesforce: Integration into a company's operations makes switching difficult.

**Data Moats**
Exclusive or vast amounts of data that improve the product or provide insights competitors can't replicate.

- Netflix: Viewer data drives personalized recommendations and original content decisions.
- Palantir: Aggregates unique datasets for defense and government clients.

**Regulatory Moats**
Gaining a competitive edge by navigating complex regulations or being first to obtain necessary licenses.

- United Health Group: Owns both insurance (UnitedHealthcare) and healthcare services (Optum) and famous for using lobbying power to shape policies that disadvantage competitors. 
- Stripe: Navigating complex financial regulations.

**Distribution Moats**
Control over or access to unique distribution channels.

- Apple App Store: Gatekeeper to millions of IOS Devices
- Shopify: Embedded into the e-commerce stack for millions of merchants.

**Customer Lock-in**
Recurring revenue models and a strong value proposition make it hard for customers to leave.

- Adobe Creative Cloud: Affordable subscription based model that ensures recurring revenue.
- AWS: Complex infrastructure integration makes switching providers painful.

**Community and Ecosystem**
Building a community that strengthens loyalty and adoption.

- GitHub: Developers rely on its ecosystem for code hosting, collaboration, and community.
- Reddit: Community driven content platform with loyal niche subreddits.

**Superior Product Experience**
Delivering an experience that consistently outshines competitors.

- Spotify: Best-in-class music discovery features like Discover Weekly.
- Sonos: Superior product experience keeps users loyal, even at premium prices.

Some companies combine moats. 

Amazon combines economies of scale, a data moat, and distribution dominance.

Google uses proprietary technology, network effects, and a data moat to maintain its edge.

Some companies are still working on building their moats like OpenAI, Airbnb, Peloton, Rivian and Doordash to name a few.

From a rational point of view taking only money into acocunt, sounds to me like freelancing/consulting is a better bet. You already have a client base bringing in more than the promised salary (at some future time), it's growing, so there's little risk, and the upside is not really limited.

On the other hand, working alongside founders in a VC-backed startup is a different way to play the game. You might prefer that even though it's high risk.

That's an odd statement. In case you're referring to the UX design, okay. In case you're referring to the software architecture, that's what the techie should deliver you, not the other way round. After all, that's why you're hiring someone with expertise. And if you're hiring someone with no expertise, then that's your problem, actually. So, the question then is how to determine as a non-technical person whether a techie you're hiring actually has or has no expertise. I would guess you have some friend somewhere out there who has a spare hour or two to help you interview and hire someone? You invite them for dinner in return, voilà. As a techie I have seen business founders trying to tell me what the right approach is. I followed them in the past some times out of courtesy, and it usually ended in a mess. But, they were not willing to listen to my own expertise.

Founders are a difficult bunch of guys, often a tiny little bit narcissistic, which sometimes makes them not see when they are going off track due to their ability to convince themselves of something. It takes a rare combination of real humbleness and vision plus intelligence to know when/how to persist in a vision and when to hand over control to others.

## Concerns You Should Address Before Considering Renting Out Compute Time
- What OS are you using? 
- Do you have it set up as a hypervisor on bare metal with a VM where you have the Qwen 3.5 setup? 
- Do you do your playing around on a separate VM to prevent polluting the configuration of the already active Qwen set up? 
- What are you running that model locally with (like ollama, llama.cpp)? 
- If privacy is a concern how are you insuring as much while exposing the model's functionality (even local network access from an internet connected machine might be more attack surface than you would be willing to expose if you realized you were still exposing some, you probably should be using some sort of cryptographic key system if you really concern)? 
- How do you back up the system's configuration and other data (are you using the 3-2-1 annoying but necessary heuristic, just dumping to a cloud drive with or without first running even a simple encryption command that can later be decrypted with a key or password? etc)

These folks hear pitches all the time so being able to visualize and see the flow is very important to getting them on board. It’s also great for presenting to the technical folks a rough idea of where you want the product to go. This is not programming, take the time to get your idea down on paper.

And then you need volume, because you will be scraping a fraction of the profit. Marketplaces aren’t a technological challenge, they are a people/personality challenge. You have to explain to investors how you are going to get BOTH sellers and buyers to come to your marketplace and what products can fit the model you have. You can’t Field of Dreams this thing.

Have you considered maybe a sliding scale agreement? So like if he invests more as you reach different milestones, his equity might change or something. Or even just starting with a smaller percentage for him could work, and then it increases based on revenue targets. Sometimes folks use milestone-based equity, which can help balance things out, especially if the investor’s cash is gonna be staggered. Just some food for thought.

679957dfbc2da607061693cc,m9oqa6v,"First off, you’re definitely not asking a stupid question. In a crowded market, it’s crucial to figure out whether to go after more traffic or tap into a potentially more profitable segment like B2B.

I’d suggest running small tests in both directions:

• Spin up a minimal B2B offer (landing page or outreach) and see if companies bite.

• Double down on B2C growth tactics or partnerships for a couple of weeks and measure the ROI.

Compare results. That data alone can provide clarity on which path truly has legs.

Second, make sure you’re monitoring your competition’s moves—especially if they start shifting toward business customers themselves or altering their pricing. Tools like BuiltWith can help you see tech stacks, and [Optic](https://withoptic.com) (our own product) tracks site and pricing changes in real-time so you can spot opportunities or threats quickly.

Where possible, look at their funnels, sign up for their newsletters, and see if they’re pivoting to B2B. If so, you can jump on the same wave. If not, there might be a gap you can fill.

Lastly, watch your own conversion metrics. If your $/1000 visitors is solid, you might just need more volume. If you’re open to more specifics, feel free to DM me. Happy to help you strategize further!",1738091663.0,1,t3_1i6ympx,startups

I was working at a consultancy firm earning a 6 figure income. Then like every other dreamer, I started realizing how disconnected I am from my true calling. So these are the measures I took:

* **I started calculating my total expenses**: I made sure to save at least 2 years of emergency funds to sustain myself and my family. 2 years is a good enough time to test your luck as a founder.
* **I created some backups**: I always maintained a healthy relationship with my peers, seniors, and managers. Plus, I had strong networks, so in case I needed to get back to a job, I wouldn't face any problems.
* **I used to work on my startup after office**. So my startup started as a side hustle. And until the day it started making enough revenue to cover my necessary expenses, I didn't quit.

You are right, I am like a scared cat. But I am sure every wannabe entrepreneur will relate to this, how difficult it is to leave the comfort of a stable job and a fat pay cheque.

Nope - by definition there are too many unknowns. There isn't a known day that someone will invest in you, how can there be a payment date? Generally it's a percentage or shares.

&gt;What else, in general, should be included in the contract, considering the job is a remote software engineering position?

I might have your responsibilities, proposed title, and the percentage or shares you will get. But I've never had a contract that specified anything but percentage/shares - your tasks might change daily.

&gt;How do they even track that you’re working the number of hours you promised?

I've never done a startup where there is a fixed number of hours. It's more of a ""take some work off of the pile"" type of thing.

&gt;Do people need to include details of their projects in the contract?

Maybe - depends on the job.

You honestly don't sound too sure about this. You're super worried about contracts and hours and money and that's fine. But a startup is often a ""make it up as we go"" type of thing. You all work your ass off getting a proof of concept going to hopefully get some investment. It's up to the CEO/CTO to determine if you're pulling your weight during the ambiguous early startup days. And, of course, you and the entire team may work your collective asses off and still fail or at least not get funded.

You have to buy into:

1. The concept of the business. Do you think that the business is a good idea? Do you think the CEO or other business focused people are realistic in their views and predictions? Don't fall for the ""this is a billion dollar idea"". Perhaps it is but decide that for yourself.
2. If you're on the tech side, is the person in charge of tech reasonable? Do they want to implement in some super esoteric language / technology that won't do you any good if this fails? Or are they realistic and are more interested in getting the thing built? Too many tech startups have someone who is too focused on the tech and not what the tech can do for the business. The tech *is* important but if your CTO thinks that it is the only thing that is important then keep looking.",1737501438.0,1,t3_1i6vumd,startups

It all comes down to should you spend time looking for a co founder or spend time building the company and product. For me it was an easy choice I wanted to go forward so I did that.

I was building an app a few years ago to serve as a “Kayak for tennis tournaments”, and wanted SMS alerts sent for new tournaments. 

Before the app was even completed I ended up subscribing to Bandwidth… for $250/mo. My logic was it’s an expensive monthly fee, but the per sms cost is cheaper at 25k (!) messages per month compared to Twilio. 

It took me 15 months to launch (perfection is the enemy of progress), and when we did we ran into problems galore with Bandwidth. Ended up cancelling and switching to Twilio. 

I sent less than 250 total SMS messages with Bandwidth, strictly for testing, and spent over $3k on it. $12/message was about what I paid. 

If I waited to implement that closer to the launch, or used Twilio to test, or just went with Twilio first and would make the switch to Bandwidth if the economics would make sense, I would have saved a ton of money, time, headache, etc. 

The app failed spectacularly for other reasons, but I learned a lot about prioritizing workflows, being more money conscious, and getting things out faster and reiterating. ",1737489868.0,37,t3_1i6r5b3,startups

2.  I had to learn a lot on the go not how to do the technical stuff but rather how to be the spider in the web. Had to learn how everything works and what challenges that comes. Outsourced the technical stuff. 

3. I built the first prototype, showed it to people in the industry and friends. When I got their input i added and removed stuff. Built prototype nr 2 did the same thing. Built prototype nr 3 and showed it at a big event and had a booth with over 5K visitor I took input from. Made prototyp nr 4 from those input. Etc. 

4. Well, there is a lot of things ofc. Often time it’s commitment and grit that people fail on. It all depends on what you trying to build. I don’t try to build a one product company so for me I see the bigger picture and long term goals. If one product fail then I build the next one and so on.

679957e2bc2da607061693f5,m8fgmhj,"I’ve had the privilege of advising a number of startup founders over the years, drawing from my experience leading user experience and customer experience teams. One thing I’ve noticed is that every founder brings their own blind spots to the table, no matter how sharp or skilled they are in their core discipline.

When we talk about “non-technical founders,” it’s usually shorthand for someone who doesn’t come from an engineering background. But even within that group, there’s a wide range of competencies. In my experience, the founders who tend to struggle the most are those with a purely sales or marketing background who aren’t self-funded. The challenge here is that these individuals often have a hard time translating ideas into something tangible—something they can validate, discuss, or show. And without their own funding to bridge the gap, they can’t just hire their way out of that lack of execution ability.

On the flip side, technical founders have their own unique blind spots. Many just want to be left alone to dive into what they find fun—solving technical problems or working on their “hobby.” But building a business is a whole different ballgame, and their reluctance (or inability) to step into that mindset can be a major hurdle.

For us, my cofounder and I were experiencing the problem and came up with a solution. 
Then we:
1. Looked at size of market and potential customer segments to see if worth pursuing. [You need to know up front if making money is possible.]
2. Looked to see what solutions exist, what kind of competition there is, how much they charge, how they sell, what their revenue is. 

(These 2 steps above are what lots of folks skip but they’re nonnegotiable. They don’t cost you a thing.)

3. Interviewed many potential customers (from our network) on job pain points to validate our premise and expand our thinking with new angles. 

4. Created paper prototypes that were kitchen sink and showed them to our network customers in interviews so we could get their reactions to different ideas. 

These 2 steps also don’t cost you a thing but are also crucial.

5. Started talking to trusted outside dev shop about feasibility of our ideas. We had the ‘here’s how we think the tech would work… is that right?’ and ‘if so, what is easy/hard?’ conversation with him. 
6. Narrowed ideas, created click through demos and continued interviewing to validate and see blind spots. 
7. Went through an accelerator; moved forward with biz side, c-corp, bootstrapping MVP with our outside dev. 
8. We have early customer interest and will launch MVP soon. (Wish us luck!)

Biggest obstacle (well, there will be many more I’m sure!) — money to pay outside dev (though we ourselves are doing data collection, model for data synthesis, prompt engineering for the AI aspect — we have tested all along with no code to see that our premise actually works.)

I believe we have all the industry, biz chops, product management experience to succeed, but it would be even better if one of us were technical. (We’re looking.)

technical feasibility? build the riskiest part first. had a client waste 6 months on the easy stuff only to find out their core feature needed machine learning they couldnt afford.

for mvp - dont build everything. seriously. one of my startup clients made bank with just a landing page and manual work behind the scenes. they validated everything before writing a single line of code.

finding users is actually pretty simple - go where they hang out. forums, reddit, discord. talk to them. but like, actually talk. dont just spam ur product.

but heres the thing about validation - its tricky. had a startup with amazing metrics fail cuz the founders couldn't work together anymore. another one ran outta cash right when things were getting good.

biggest mistake i made? thinking good code = good business. spent months making things perfect instead of getting it in front of users. now at 500K Agency we always push clients to launch faster, even if its not perfect.
